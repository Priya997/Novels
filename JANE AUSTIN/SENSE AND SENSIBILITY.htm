<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 1</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The family of Dashwood had long been 
settled in Sussex.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their estate was large, and their 
residence was at Norland Park,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the centre of their property, where, 
for many generations,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they had lived in so respectable a 
manner as to engage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the general good opinion of their 
surrounding acquaintance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The late owner of this estate was 
a single man, who lived</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to a very advanced age, and who for 
many years of his life,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had a constant companion and housekeeper 
in his sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But her death, which happened ten 
years before his own,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">produced a great alteration in his 
home; for to supply</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her loss, he invited and received 
into his house the family</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, 
the legal inheritor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the Norland estate, and the person 
to whom he intended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to bequeath it.  In the society of 
his nephew and niece,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and their children, the old Gentleman's 
days were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comfortably spent.  His attachment 
to them all increased.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The constant attention of Mr. and 
Mrs. Henry Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to his wishes, which proceeded not 
merely from interest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but from goodness of heart, gave him 
every degree of solid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comfort which his age could receive; 
and the cheerfulness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the children added a relish to 
his existence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood 
had one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">son: by his present lady, three daughters.  
The son,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a steady respectable young man, was 
amply provided</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for by the fortune of his mother, 
which had been large,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and half of which devolved on him 
on his coming of age.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">By his own marriage, likewise, which 
happened soon afterwards,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he added to his wealth. To him therefore 
the succession</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the Norland estate was not so really 
important as to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his sisters; for their fortune, independent 
of what might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">arise to them from their father's 
inheriting that property,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could be but small.  Their mother 
had nothing, and their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">father only seven thousand pounds 
in his own disposal;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the remaining moiety of his first 
wife's fortune was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">also secured to her child, and he 
had only a life-interest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The old gentleman died: his will was 
read, and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">like almost every other will, gave 
as much disappointment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as pleasure.  He was neither so unjust, 
nor so ungrateful,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as to leave his estate from his nephew;--but 
he left it to him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on such terms as destroyed half the 
value of the bequest.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more 
for the sake of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wife and daughters than for himself 
or his son;--but to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his son, and his son's son, a child 
of four years old,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was secured, in such a way, as 
to leave to himself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no power of providing for those who 
were most dear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to him, and who most needed a provision 
by any charge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the estate, or by any sale of its 
valuable woods.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The whole was tied up for the benefit 
of this child, who,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in occasional visits with his father 
and mother at Norland,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had so far gained on the affections 
of his uncle,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by such attractions as are by no means 
unusual in children</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of two or three years old; an imperfect 
articulation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an earnest desire of having his own 
way, many cunning tricks,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh 
all the value</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all the attention which, for years, 
he had received</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from his niece and her daughters.  
He meant not to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be unkind, however, and, as a mark 
of his affection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the three girls, he left them 
a thousand pounds a-piece.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Dashwood's disappointment was, 
at first, severe;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but his temper was cheerful and sanguine; 
and he might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reasonably hope to live many years, 
and by living economically,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lay by a considerable sum from the 
produce of an estate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">already large, and capable of almost 
immediate improvement.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But the fortune, which had been so 
tardy in coming, was his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only one twelvemonth.  He survived 
his uncle no longer;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and ten thousand pounds, including 
the late legacies,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was all that remained for his widow 
and daughters.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His son was sent for as soon as his 
danger was known,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to him Mr. Dashwood recommended, 
with all the strength</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and urgency which illness could command, 
the interest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his mother-in-law and sisters.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong 
feelings of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rest of the family; but he was affected 
by a recommendation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of such a nature at such a time, and 
he promised to do</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every thing in his power to make them 
comfortable.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His father was rendered easy by such 
an assurance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure 
to consider how</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much there might prudently be in his 
power to do for them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was not an ill-disposed young man, 
unless to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be rather cold hearted and rather 
selfish is to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ill-disposed: but he was, in general, 
well respected;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for he conducted himself with propriety 
in the discharge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his ordinary duties. Had he married 
a more amiable woman,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he might have been made still more 
respectable than he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was:--he might even have been made 
amiable himself; for he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was very young when he married, and 
very fond of his wife.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong 
caricature of himself;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more narrow-minded and selfish.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When he gave his promise to his father, 
he meditated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">within himself to increase the fortunes 
of his sisters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the present of a thousand pounds 
a-piece. He then</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">really thought himself equal to it.  
The prospect of four</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thousand a-year, in addition to his 
present income,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">besides the remaining half of his 
own mother's fortune,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">warmed his heart, and made him feel 
capable of generosity.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, he would give them three 
thousand pounds: it would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be liberal and handsome! It would 
be enough to make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them completely easy.  Three thousand 
pounds! he could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spare so considerable a sum with little 
inconvenience.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He thought of it all day long, and 
for many days successively,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he did not repent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No sooner was his father's funeral 
over, than Mrs. John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dashwood, without sending any notice 
of her intention to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother-in-law, arrived with her child 
and their attendants.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No one could dispute her right to 
come; the house was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her husband's from the moment of his 
father's decease;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the indelicacy of her conduct 
was so much the greater,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood's 
situation, with only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">common feelings, must have been highly 
unpleasing;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but in HER mind there was a sense 
of honor so keen,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a generosity so romantic, that any 
offence of the kind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by whomsoever given or received, was 
to her a source</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of immoveable disgust.  Mrs. John 
Dashwood had never</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been a favourite with any of her husband's 
family;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but she had had no opportunity, till 
the present,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of shewing them with how little attention 
to the comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of other people she could act when 
occasion required it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel 
this ungracious</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaviour, and so earnestly did she 
despise her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">daughter-in-law for it, that, on the 
arrival of the latter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she would have quitted the house for 
ever, had not the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entreaty of her eldest girl induced 
her first to reflect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the propriety of going, and her 
own tender love for all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her three children determined her 
afterwards to stay,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and for their sakes avoid a breach 
with their brother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose 
advice was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so effectual, possessed a strength 
of understanding,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and coolness of judgment, which qualified 
her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though only nineteen, to be the counsellor 
of her mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and enabled her frequently to counteract, 
to the advantage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of them all, that eagerness of mind 
in Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which must generally have led to imprudence.  
She had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an excellent heart;--her disposition 
was affectionate,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her feelings were strong; but 
she knew how to govern</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them: it was a knowledge which her 
mother had yet to learn;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and which one of her sisters had resolved 
never to be taught.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's abilities were, in many 
respects,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite equal to Elinor's. She was sensible 
and clever;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but eager in everything: her sorrows, 
her joys, could have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no moderation.  She was generous, 
amiable, interesting: she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was everything but prudent.  The resemblance 
between</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her and her mother was strikingly 
great.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor saw, with concern, the excess 
of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister's sensibility; but by Mrs. 
Dashwood it was valued</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and cherished.  They encouraged each 
other now in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">violence of their affliction. The 
agony of grief</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which overpowered them at first, was 
voluntarily renewed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was sought for, was created again 
and again.  They gave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">themselves up wholly to their sorrow, 
seeking increase</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of wretchedness in every reflection 
that could afford it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and resolved against ever admitting 
consolation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in future.  Elinor, too, was deeply 
afflicted; but still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could struggle, she could exert 
herself.  She could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">consult with her brother, could receive 
her sister-in-law</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her arrival, and treat her with 
proper attention;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and could strive to rouse her mother 
to similar exertion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and encourage her to similar forbearance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Margaret, the other sister, was a 
good-humored,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well-disposed girl; but as she had 
already imbibed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a good deal of Marianne's romance, 
without having</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much of her sense, she did not, at 
thirteen, bid fair</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to equal her sisters at a more advanced 
period of life.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 2</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself 
mistress</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law 
were degraded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the condition of visitors.  As 
such, however, they were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">treated by her with quiet civility; 
and by her husband</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with as much kindness as he could 
feel towards anybody</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beyond himself, his wife, and their 
child.  He really</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pressed them, with some earnestness, 
to consider Norland</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as their home; and, as no plan appeared 
so eligible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there 
till she could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">accommodate herself with a house in 
the neighbourhood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his invitation was accepted.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A continuance in a place where everything 
reminded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her of former delight, was exactly 
what suited her mind.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper 
could be more cheerful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than hers, or possess, in a greater 
degree, that sanguine</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expectation of happiness which is 
happiness itself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But in sorrow she must be equally 
carried away by her fancy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as far beyond consolation as in 
pleasure she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beyond alloy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all 
approve of what her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">husband intended to do for his sisters.  
To take three</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thousand pounds from the fortune of 
their dear little boy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would be impoverishing him to the 
most dreadful degree.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She begged him to think again on the 
subject.  How could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he answer it to himself to rob his 
child, and his only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">child too, of so large a sum?  And 
what possible claim</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could the Miss Dashwoods, who were 
related to him only by</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">half blood, which she considered as 
no relationship at all,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have on his generosity to so large 
an amount.  It was very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well known that no affection was ever 
supposed to exist</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">between the children of any man by 
different marriages;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and why was he to ruin himself, and 
their poor little Harry,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by giving away all his money to his 
half sisters?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It was my father's last request 
to me,&quot; replied</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her husband, &quot;that I should assist 
his widow and daughters.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He did not know what he was 
talking of, I dare say;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ten to one but he was light-headed 
at the time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Had he been in his right senses, he 
could not have thought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of such a thing as begging you to 
give away half your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fortune from your own child.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He did not stipulate for any 
particular sum,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my dear Fanny; he only requested me, 
in general terms,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to assist them, and make their situation 
more comfortable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than it was in his power to do.  Perhaps 
it would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been as well if he had left it 
wholly to myself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He could hardly suppose I should neglect 
them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But as he required the promise, I 
could not do less</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than give it; at least I thought so 
at the time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The promise, therefore, was given, 
and must be performed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Something must be done for them whenever 
they leave Norland</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and settle in a new home.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, then, LET something be 
done for them;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but THAT something need not be three 
thousand pounds.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Consider,&quot; she added, &quot;that 
when the money is once</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">parted with, it never can return. Your 
sisters will marry,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it will be gone for ever.  If, 
indeed, it could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be restored to our poor little boy--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why, to be sure,&quot; said 
her husband, very gravely,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;that would make great difference.  
The time may come when</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Harry will regret that so large a 
sum was parted with.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If he should have a numerous family, 
for instance, it would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be a very convenient addition.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To be sure it would.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps, then, it would be better 
for all parties,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if the sum were diminished one half.--Five 
hundred pounds</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would be a prodigious increase to 
their fortunes!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! beyond anything great!  
What brother on earth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would do half so much for his sisters, 
even if REALLY</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his sisters!  And as it is--only half 
blood!--But you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have such a generous spirit!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I would not wish to do any thing 
mean,&quot; he replied.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;One had rather, on such occasions, 
do too much than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too little.  No one, at least, can 
think I have not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">done enough for them: even themselves, 
they can hardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expect more.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There is no knowing what THEY 
may expect,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said the lady, &quot;but we are not 
to think of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expectations: the question is, what 
you can afford to do.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly--and I think I may 
afford to give them five</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hundred pounds a-piece.  As it is, 
without any addition</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of mine, they will each have about 
three thousand pounds</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on their mother's death--a very comfortable 
fortune</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for any young woman.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To be sure it is; and, indeed, 
it strikes me that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they can want no addition at all. They 
will have ten</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thousand pounds divided amongst them. 
 If they marry,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they will be sure of doing well, and 
if they do not,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they may all live very comfortably 
together on the interest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of ten thousand pounds.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is very true, and, therefore, 
I do not know whether,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">upon the whole, it would not be more 
advisable to do</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">something for their mother while she 
lives, rather than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for them--something of the annuity 
kind I mean.--My sisters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would feel the good effects of it 
as well as herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A hundred a year would make them all 
perfectly comfortable.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His wife hesitated a little, however, 
in giving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her consent to this plan.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To be sure,&quot; said she, 
&quot;it is better than parting with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fifteen hundred pounds at once.  But, 
then, if Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should live fifteen years we shall 
be completely taken in.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Fifteen years! my dear Fanny; 
her life cannot</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be worth half that purchase.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly not; but if you observe, 
people always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">live for ever when there is an annuity 
to be paid them;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she is very stout and healthy, 
and hardly forty.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">An annuity is a very serious business; 
it comes over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and over every year, and there is 
no getting rid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it.  You are not aware of what 
you are doing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have known a great deal of the trouble 
of annuities;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for my mother was clogged with the 
payment of three</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to old superannuated servants by my 
father's will,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it is amazing how disagreeable 
she found it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Twice every year these annuities were 
to be paid; and then</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there was the trouble of getting it 
to them; and then one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of them was said to have died, and 
afterwards it turned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out to be no such thing.  My mother 
was quite sick of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her income was not her own, she said, 
with such perpetual</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">claims on it; and it was the more 
unkind in my father,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because, otherwise, the money would 
have been entirely at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my mother's disposal, without any 
restriction whatever.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It has given me such an abhorrence 
of annuities, that I am</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sure I would not pin myself down to 
the payment of one for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all the world.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is certainly an unpleasant 
thing,&quot; replied Mr. Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;to have those kind of yearly 
drains on one's income.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One's fortune, as your mother justly 
says, is NOT one's own.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To be tied down to the regular payment 
of such a sum,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on every rent day, is by no means 
desirable: it takes away</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one's independence.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Undoubtedly; and after all you 
have no thanks for it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They think themselves secure, you 
do no more than what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is expected, and it raises no gratitude 
at all.  If I were you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whatever I did should be done at my 
own discretion entirely.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I would not bind myself to allow them 
any thing yearly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It may be very inconvenient some years 
to spare a hundred,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or even fifty pounds from our own 
expenses.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I believe you are right, my 
love; it will be better</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that there should by no annuity in 
the case; whatever I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may give them occasionally will be 
of far greater assistance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than a yearly allowance, because they 
would only enlarge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their style of living if they felt 
sure of a larger income,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and would not be sixpence the richer 
for it at the end</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the year.  It will certainly be 
much the best way.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A present of fifty pounds, now and 
then, will prevent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their ever being distressed for money, 
and will, I think,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be amply discharging my promise to 
my father.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To be sure it will.  Indeed, 
to say the truth,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am convinced within myself that 
your father had no idea</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of your giving them any money at all.  
The assistance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he thought of, I dare say, was only 
such as might be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reasonably expected of you; for instance, 
such as looking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out for a comfortable small house 
for them, helping them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to move their things, and sending 
them presents of fish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and game, and so forth, whenever they 
are in season.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I'll lay my life that he meant nothing 
farther; indeed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it would be very strange and unreasonable 
if he did.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, 
how excessively</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comfortable your mother-in-law and 
her daughters may live</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the interest of seven thousand 
pounds, besides the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thousand pounds belonging to each 
of the girls, which brings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, 
and, of course,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they will pay their mother for their 
board out of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Altogether, they will have five hundred 
a-year amongst them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and what on earth can four women want 
for more than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that?--They will live so cheap! Their 
housekeeping will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be nothing at all. They will have 
no carriage, no horses,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and hardly any servants; they will 
keep no company,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and can have no expenses of any kind!  
Only conceive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how comfortable they will be!  Five 
hundred a year! I am</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sure I cannot imagine how they will 
spend half of it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as to your giving them more, it 
is quite absurd to think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it.  They will be much more able 
to give YOU something.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon my word,&quot; said Mr. 
Dashwood, &quot;I believe you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are perfectly right.  My father certainly 
could mean</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing more by his request to me 
than what you say.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I clearly understand it now, and I 
will strictly fulfil</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my engagement by such acts of assistance 
and kindness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to them as you have described.  When 
my mother removes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into another house my services shall 
be readily given</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to accommodate her as far as I can.  
Some little present</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of furniture too may be acceptable 
then.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly,&quot;returned Mrs. 
John Dashwood.  &quot;But, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ONE thing must be considered. When 
your father and mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">moved to Norland, though the furniture 
of Stanhill</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was sold, all the china, plate, and 
linen was saved,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and is now left to your mother.  Her 
house will therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be almost completely fitted up as 
soon as she takes it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is a material consideration 
undoubtedly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A valuable legacy indeed! And yet 
some of the plate would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been a very pleasant addition 
to our own stock here.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes; and the set of breakfast 
china is twice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as handsome as what belongs to this 
house.  A great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">deal too handsome, in my opinion, 
for any place THEY</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can ever afford to live in.  But, 
however, so it is.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Your father thought only of THEM.  
And I must say this:</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that you owe no particular gratitude 
to him, nor attention</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to his wishes; for we very well know 
that if he could,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he would have left almost everything 
in the world to THEM.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This argument was irresistible.  It 
gave to his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intentions whatever of decision was 
wanting before; and he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">finally resolved, that it would be 
absolutely unnecessary,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if not highly indecorous, to do more 
for the widow</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and children of his father, than such 
kind of neighbourly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acts as his own wife pointed out.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 3</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland 
several months;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not from any disinclination to move 
when the sight of every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well known spot ceased to raise the 
violent emotion which it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">produced for a while; for when her 
spirits began to revive,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her mind became capable of some 
other exertion than that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of heightening its affliction by melancholy 
remembrances,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was impatient to be gone, and 
indefatigable in her inquiries</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood 
of Norland;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for to remove far from that beloved 
spot was impossible.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But she could hear of no situation 
that at once answered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her notions of comfort and ease, and 
suited the prudence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her eldest daughter, whose steadier 
judgment rejected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">several houses as too large for their 
income, which her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother would have approved.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by 
her husband of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">solemn promise on the part of his 
son in their favour,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which gave comfort to his last earthly 
reflections.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She doubted the sincerity of this 
assurance no more than he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had doubted it himself, and she thought 
of it for her daughters'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sake with satisfaction, though as 
for herself she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">persuaded that a much smaller provision 
than 7000L would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">support her in affluence.  For their 
brother's sake, too,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the sake of his own heart, she 
rejoiced; and she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reproached herself for being unjust 
to his merit before,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in believing him incapable of generosity.  
His attentive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaviour to herself and his sisters 
convinced her that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their welfare was dear to him, and, 
for a long time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she firmly relied on the liberality 
of his intentions.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The contempt which she had, very early 
in their acquaintance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">felt for her daughter-in-law, was 
very much increased</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the farther knowledge of her character, 
which half</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a year's residence in her family afforded; 
and perhaps</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in spite of every consideration of 
politeness or maternal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection on the side of the former, 
the two ladies might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have found it impossible to have lived 
together so long,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had not a particular circumstance 
occurred to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">still greater eligibility, according 
to the opinions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Mrs. Dashwood, to her daughters' 
continuance at Norland.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This circumstance was a growing attachment 
between</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her eldest girl and the brother of 
Mrs. John Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a gentleman-like and pleasing young 
man, who was introduced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to their acquaintance soon after his 
sister's establishment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Norland, and who had since spent 
the greatest part</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his time there.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Some mothers might have encouraged 
the intimacy from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">motives of interest, for Edward Ferrars 
was the eldest son</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a man who had died very rich; and 
some might have repressed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it from motives of prudence, for, 
except a trifling sum,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the whole of his fortune depended 
on the will of his mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced 
by either consideration.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was enough for her that he appeared 
to be amiable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he loved her daughter, and that 
Elinor returned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the partiality.  It was contrary to 
every doctrine of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her's that difference of fortune should 
keep any couple</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">asunder who were attracted by resemblance 
of disposition;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that Elinor's merit should not 
be acknowledged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by every one who knew her, was to 
her comprehension impossible.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward Ferrars was not recommended 
to their good</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opinion by any peculiar graces of 
person or address.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was not handsome, and his manners 
required intimacy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make them pleasing.  He was too 
diffident to do justice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to himself; but when his natural shyness 
was overcome,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his behaviour gave every indication 
of an open,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affectionate heart.  His understanding 
was good,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his education had given it solid 
improvement.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But he was neither fitted by abilities 
nor disposition</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to answer the wishes of his mother 
and sister, who longed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see him distinguished--as--they 
hardly knew what.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They wanted him to make a fine figure 
in the world in some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">manner or other.  His mother wished 
to interest him in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">political concerns, to get him into 
parliament, or to see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him connected with some of the great 
men of the day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. John Dashwood wished it likewise; 
but in the mean while,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">till one of these superior blessings 
could be attained, it would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have quieted her ambition to see him 
driving a barouche.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Edward had no turn for great men 
or barouches.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">All his wishes centered in domestic 
comfort and the quiet</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of private life.  Fortunately he had 
a younger brother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who was more promising.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward had been staying several weeks 
in the house</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before he engaged much of Mrs. Dashwood's 
attention;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for she was, at that time, in such 
affliction as rendered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her careless of surrounding objects.  
She saw only that he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was quiet and unobtrusive, and she 
liked him for it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He did not disturb the wretchedness 
of her mind by</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ill-timed conversation.  She was first 
called to observe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and approve him farther, by a reflection 
which Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">chanced one day to make on the difference 
between him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his sister.  It was a contrast 
which recommended him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">most forcibly to her mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is enough,&quot; said she; 
&quot;to say that he is unlike</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fanny is enough.  It implies everything 
amiable.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I love him already.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I think you will like him,&quot; 
said Elinor, &quot;when you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know more of him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Like him!&quot; replied her 
mother with a smile.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I feel no sentiment of approbation 
inferior to love.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You may esteem him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have never yet known what 
it was to separate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">esteem and love.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get 
acquainted with him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her manners were attaching, and soon 
banished his reserve.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She speedily comprehended all his 
merits; the persuasion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his regard for Elinor perhaps assisted 
her penetration;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but she really felt assured of his 
worth: and even that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quietness of manner, which militated 
against all her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">established ideas of what a young 
man's address ought to be,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was no longer uninteresting when she 
knew his heart to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">warm and his temper affectionate.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No sooner did she perceive any symptom 
of love</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his behaviour to Elinor, than she 
considered their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">serious attachment as certain, and 
looked forward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to their marriage as rapidly approaching.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;In a few months, my dear Marianne.&quot; 
said she,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Elinor will, in all probability 
be settled for life.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">We shall miss her; but SHE will be 
happy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! Mamma, how shall we do without 
her?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My love, it will be scarcely 
a separation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">We shall live within a few miles of 
each other, and shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">meet every day of our lives. You will 
gain a brother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a real, affectionate brother.  I have 
the highest opinion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world of Edward's heart.  But 
you look grave,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne; do you disapprove your sister's 
choice?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps,&quot;said Marianne, 
&quot;I may consider it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with some surprise.  Edward is very 
amiable, and I love</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him tenderly.  But yet--he is not 
the kind of young</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">man--there is something wanting--his 
figure is not striking;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it has none of that grace which I 
should expect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the man who could seriously attach 
my sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His eyes want all that spirit, that 
fire, which at once</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">announce virtue and intelligence.  
And besides all this,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am afraid, Mamma, he has no real 
taste.  Music seems</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">scarcely to attract him, and though 
he admires Elinor's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">drawings very much, it is not the 
admiration of a person</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who can understand their worth.  It 
is evident, in spite of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his frequent attention to her while 
she draws, that in fact</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he knows nothing of the matter.  He 
admires as a lover,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not as a connoisseur.  To satisfy 
me, those characters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be united.  I could not be happy 
with a man whose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">taste did not in every point coincide 
with my own.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He must enter into all my feelings; 
the same books,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the same music must charm us both. Oh! 
mama, how spiritless,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how tame was Edward's manner in reading 
to us last night!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I felt for my sister most severely.  
Yet she bore it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with so much composure, she seemed 
scarcely to notice it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I could hardly keep my seat.  To hear 
those beautiful lines</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which have frequently almost driven 
me wild, pronounced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with such impenetrable calmness, such 
dreadful indifference!&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He would certainly have done 
more justice to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">simple and elegant prose.  I thought 
so at the time;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but you WOULD give him Cowper.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Nay, Mamma, if he is not to 
be animated by Cowper!--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but we must allow for difference of 
taste.  Elinor has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not my feelings, and therefore she 
may overlook it, and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be happy with him.  But it would have 
broke MY heart,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had I loved him, to hear him read 
with so little sensibility.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mama, the more I know of the world, 
the more am I convinced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that I shall never see a man whom 
I can really love.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I require so much!  He must have all 
Edward's virtues,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his person and manners must ornament 
his goodness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with every possible charm.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Remember, my love, that you 
are not seventeen.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is yet too early in life to despair 
of such a happiness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Why should you be less fortunate than 
your mother?  In</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one circumstance only, my Marianne, 
may your destiny be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">different from her's!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 4</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What a pity it is, Elinor,&quot; 
said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;that Edward should have no taste 
for drawing.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No taste for drawing!&quot; 
replied Elinor, &quot;why should</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you think so? He does not draw himself, 
indeed, but he has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great pleasure in seeing the performances 
of other people,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I assure you he is by no means 
deficient in natural taste,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though he has not had opportunities 
of improving it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Had he ever been in the way of learning, 
I think he would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have drawn very well.  He distrusts 
his own judgment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in such matters so much, that he is 
always unwilling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to give his opinion on any picture; 
but he has an innate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">propriety and simplicity of taste, 
which in general</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">direct him perfectly right.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was afraid of offending, 
and said no more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the subject; but the kind of approbation 
which Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">described as excited in him by the 
drawings of other</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">people, was very far from that rapturous 
delight, which,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her opinion, could alone be called 
taste.  Yet, though</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">smiling within herself at the mistake, 
she honoured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister for that blind partiality 
to Edward which produced it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I hope, Marianne,&quot; continued 
Elinor, &quot;you do not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">consider him as deficient in general 
taste.  Indeed, I think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I may say that you cannot, for your 
behaviour to him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is perfectly cordial, and if THAT 
were your opinion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure you could never be civil 
to him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne hardly knew what to say.  
She would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not wound the feelings of her sister 
on any account,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and yet to say what she did not believe 
was impossible.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At length she replied:</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do not be offended, Elinor, 
if my praise of him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is not in every thing equal to your 
sense of his merits.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have not had so many opportunities 
of estimating the minuter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">propensities of his mind, his inclinations 
and tastes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as you have; but I have the highest 
opinion in the world</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his goodness and sense.  I think 
him every thing that is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">worthy and amiable.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am sure,&quot; replied Elinor, 
with a smile,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;that his dearest friends could 
not be dissatisfied</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with such commendation as that.  I 
do not perceive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how you could express yourself more 
warmly.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was rejoiced to find her 
sister so easily pleased.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Of his sense and his goodness,&quot; 
continued Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;no one can, I think, be in doubt, 
who has seen him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">often enough to engage him in unreserved 
conversation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The excellence of his understanding 
and his principles</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can be concealed only by that shyness 
which too often</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">keeps him silent.  You know enough 
of him to do justice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to his solid worth.  But of his minuter 
propensities,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as you call them you have from peculiar 
circumstances</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been kept more ignorant than myself.  
He and I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been at times thrown a good deal together, 
while you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been wholly engrossed on the 
most affectionate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">principle by my mother. I have seen 
a great deal of him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have studied his sentiments and heard 
his opinion on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subjects of literature and taste; 
and, upon the whole,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I venture to pronounce that his mind 
is well-informed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enjoyment of books exceedingly great, 
his imagination lively,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his observation just and correct, 
and his taste delicate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and pure.  His abilities in every 
respect improve</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as much upon acquaintance as his manners 
and person.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At first sight, his address is certainly 
not striking;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his person can hardly be called 
handsome, till the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expression of his eyes, which are 
uncommonly good,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the general sweetness of his countenance, 
is perceived.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At present, I know him so well, that 
I think him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">really handsome; or at least, almost 
so.  What say you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I shall very soon think him 
handsome, Elinor, if I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">do not now.  When you tell me to love 
him as a brother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I shall no more see imperfection in 
his face, than I now do</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his heart.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor started at this declaration, 
and was sorry for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the warmth she had been betrayed into, 
in speaking of him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She felt that Edward stood very high 
in her opinion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She believed the regard to be mutual; 
but she required</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">greater certainty of it to make Marianne's 
conviction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their attachment agreeable to her.  
She knew that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what Marianne and her mother conjectured 
one moment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they believed the next--that with 
them, to wish was to hope,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to hope was to expect.  She tried 
to explain the real</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">state of the case to her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not attempt to deny,&quot; 
said she, &quot;that I think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very highly of him--that I greatly 
esteem, that I like him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne here burst forth with indignation--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Esteem him! Like him! Cold-hearted 
Elinor! Oh!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of 
being otherwise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Use those words again, and I will 
leave the room this moment.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not help laughing.  &quot;Excuse 
me,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said she;&quot;and be assured that 
I meant no offence to you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by speaking, in so quiet a way, of 
my own feelings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Believe them to be stronger than I 
have declared;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">believe them, in short, to be such 
as his merit, and the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suspicion--the hope of his affection 
for me may warrant,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without imprudence or folly.  But 
farther than this you must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not believe.  I am by no means assured 
of his regard for me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">There are moments when the extent 
of it seems doubtful;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and till his sentiments are fully 
known, you cannot wonder</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at my wishing to avoid any encouragement 
of my own partiality,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by believing or calling it more than 
it is.  In my heart</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I feel little--scarcely any doubt 
of his preference.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But there are other points to be considered 
besides</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his inclination.  He is very far from 
being independent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What his mother really is we cannot 
know; but, from Fanny's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">occasional mention of her conduct 
and opinions, we have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never been disposed to think her amiable; 
and I am very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much mistaken if Edward is not himself 
aware that there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would be many difficulties in his 
way, if he were to wish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to marry a woman who had not either 
a great fortune or</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">high rank.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was astonished to find how 
much the imagination</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her mother and herself had outstripped 
the truth.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And you really are not engaged 
to him!&quot; said she.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yet it certainly soon will happen.  
But two advantages</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will proceed from this delay.  I shall 
not lose you so soon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Edward will have greater opportunity 
of improving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that natural taste for your favourite 
pursuit which must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be so indispensably necessary to your 
future felicity.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Oh! if he should be so far stimulated 
by your genius as to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">learn to draw himself, how delightful 
it would be!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor had given her real opinion 
to her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She could not consider her partiality 
for Edward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in so prosperous a state as Marianne 
had believed it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">There was, at times, a want of spirits 
about him which,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if it did not denote indifference, 
spoke a something almost</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as unpromising.  A doubt of her regard, 
supposing him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to feel it, need not give him more 
than inquietude.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It would not be likely to produce 
that dejection of mind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which frequently attended him.  A 
more reasonable cause</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might be found in the dependent situation 
which forbad</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the indulgence of his affection.  
She knew that his mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">neither behaved to him so as to make 
his home comfortable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at present, nor to give him any assurance 
that he might form</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a home for himself, without strictly 
attending to her views</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for his aggrandizement.  With such 
a knowledge as this,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was impossible for Elinor to feel 
easy on the subject.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was far from depending on that 
result of his preference</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her, which her mother and sister 
still considered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as certain.  Nay, the longer they 
were together the more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">doubtful seemed the nature of his 
regard; and sometimes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a few painful minutes, she believed 
it to be no more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than friendship.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But, whatever might really be its 
limits, it was enough,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when perceived by his sister, to make 
her uneasy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and at the same time, (which was still 
more common,)</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make her uncivil.  She took the 
first opportunity of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affronting her mother-in-law on the 
occasion, talking to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her so expressively of her brother's 
great expectations,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Mrs. Ferrars's resolution that 
both her sons should</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">marry well, and of the danger attending 
any young woman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who attempted to DRAW HIM IN; that 
Mrs. Dashwood could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">neither pretend to be unconscious, 
nor endeavor to be calm.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She gave her an answer which marked 
her contempt,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and instantly left the room, resolving 
that, whatever might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be the inconvenience or expense of 
so sudden a removal,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her beloved Elinor should not be exposed 
another week</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to such insinuations.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In this state of her spirits, a letter 
was delivered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her from the post, which contained 
a proposal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">particularly well timed. It was the 
offer of a small house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on very easy terms, belonging to a 
relation of her own,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a gentleman of consequence and property 
in Devonshire.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The letter was from this gentleman 
himself, and written</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the true spirit of friendly accommodation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He understood that she was in need 
of a dwelling;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and though the house he now offered 
her was merely a cottage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he assured her that everything should 
be done to it which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she might think necessary, if the 
situation pleased her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He earnestly pressed her, after giving 
the particulars</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the house and garden, to come with 
her daughters to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Barton Park, the place of his own 
residence, from whence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she might judge, herself, whether 
Barton Cottage, for the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">houses were in the same parish, could, 
by any alteration,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be made comfortable to her.  He seemed 
really anxious to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">accommodate them and the whole of 
his letter was written</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in so friendly a style as could not 
fail of giving pleasure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to his cousin; more especially at 
a moment when she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suffering under the cold and unfeeling 
behaviour of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nearer connections.  She needed no 
time for deliberation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or inquiry. Her resolution was formed 
as she read.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The situation of Barton, in a county 
so far distant from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a 
few hours before,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would have been a sufficient objection 
to outweigh every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possible advantage belonging to the 
place, was now its</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">first recommendation.  To quit the 
neighbourhood of Norland</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was no longer an evil; it was an object 
of desire;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was a blessing, in comparison of 
the misery of continuing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her daughter-in-law's guest; and to 
remove for ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from that beloved place would be less 
painful than to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inhabit or visit it while such a woman 
was its mistress.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She instantly wrote Sir John Middleton 
her acknowledgment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his kindness, and her acceptance 
of his proposal;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and then hastened to shew both letters 
to her daughters,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she might be secure of their 
approbation before her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">answer were sent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor had always thought it would 
be more prudent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for them to settle at some distance 
from Norland,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than immediately amongst their present 
acquaintance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On THAT head, therefore, it was not 
for her to oppose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her mother's intention of removing 
into Devonshire.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The house, too, as described by Sir 
John, was on so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">simple a scale, and the rent so uncommonly 
moderate,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as to leave her no right of objection 
on either point;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and, therefore, though it was not 
a plan which brought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any charm to her fancy, though it 
was a removal from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the vicinity of Norland beyond her 
wishes, she made</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no attempt to dissuade her mother 
from sending a letter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of acquiescence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No sooner was her answer dispatched, 
than Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indulged herself in the pleasure of 
announcing to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">son-in-law and his wife that she was 
provided with a house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and should incommode them no longer 
than till every thing were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ready for her inhabiting it.  They 
heard her with surprise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but 
her husband civilly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hoped that she would not be settled 
far from Norland.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She had great satisfaction in replying 
that she was going</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into Devonshire.--Edward turned hastily 
towards her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on hearing this, and, in a voice of 
surprise and concern,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which required no explanation to her, 
repeated,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Devonshire! Are you, indeed, 
going there?  So far from hence!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And to what part of it?&quot;  She 
explained the situation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was within four miles northward 
of Exeter.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is but a cottage,&quot; she 
continued, &quot;but I hope</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see many of my friends in it.  
A room or two can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">easily be added; and if my friends 
find no difficulty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in travelling so far to see me, I 
am sure I will find</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">none in accommodating them.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She concluded with a very kind invitation 
to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit 
her at Barton;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to Edward she gave one with still 
greater affection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Though her late conversation with 
her daughter-in-law had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made her resolve on remaining at Norland 
no longer than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was unavoidable, it had not produced 
the smallest effect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her in that point to which it principally 
tended.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To separate Edward and Elinor was 
as far from being her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">object as ever; and she wished to 
show Mrs. John Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by this pointed invitation to her 
brother, how totally she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disregarded her disapprobation of 
the match.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. John Dashwood told his mother 
again and again</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how exceedingly sorry he was that 
she had taken a house at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such a distance from Norland as to 
prevent his being of any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">service to her in removing her furniture.  
He really felt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conscientiously vexed on the occasion; 
for the very exertion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to which he had limited the performance 
of his promise to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his father was by this arrangement 
rendered impracticable.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The furniture was all sent around 
by water.  It chiefly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">consisted of household linen, plate, 
china, and books,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's.  
Mrs. John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dashwood saw the packages depart with 
a sigh: she could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. 
Dashwood's income</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would be so trifling in comparison 
with their own,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she should have any handsome article 
of furniture.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a 
twelvemonth; it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ready furnished, and she might have 
immediate possession.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No difficulty arose on either side 
in the agreement; and she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">waited only for the disposal of her 
effects at Norland,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to determine her future household, 
before she set</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">off for the west; and this, as she 
was exceedingly rapid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the performance of everything that 
interested her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was soon done.--The horses which were 
left her by her husband</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been sold soon after his death, 
and an opportunity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now offering of disposing of her carriage, 
she agreed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to sell that likewise at the earnest 
advice of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">eldest daughter.  For the comfort 
of her children, had she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">consulted only her own wishes, she 
would have kept it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the discretion of Elinor prevailed.  
HER wisdom</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too limited the number of their servants 
to three;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two maids and a man, with whom they 
were speedily provided</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from amongst those who had formed 
their establishment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Norland.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The man and one of the maids were 
sent off immediately</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into Devonshire, to prepare the house 
for their mistress's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">arrival; for as Lady Middleton was 
entirely unknown</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going 
directly to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cottage to being a visitor at Barton 
Park; and she relied</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so undoubtingly on Sir John's description 
of the house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as to feel no curiosity to examine 
it herself till she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entered it as her own. Her eagerness 
to be gone from Norland</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was preserved from diminution by the 
evident satisfaction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her daughter-in-law in the prospect 
of her removal;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a satisfaction which was but feebly 
attempted to be concealed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">under a cold invitation to her to 
defer her departure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Now was the time when her son-in-law's 
promise to his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">father might with particular propriety 
be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Since he had neglected to do it on 
first coming to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the estate, their quitting his house 
might be looked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on as the most suitable period for 
its accomplishment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to 
give over every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hope of the kind, and to be convinced, 
from the general</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">drift of his discourse, that his assistance 
extended no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">farther than their maintenance for 
six months at Norland.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He so frequently talked of the increasing 
expenses</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of housekeeping, and of the perpetual 
demands upon his purse,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which a man of any consequence in 
the world was beyond</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">calculation exposed to, that he seemed 
rather to stand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in need of more money himself than 
to have any design of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">giving money away.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In a very few weeks from the day which 
brought Sir</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">John Middleton's first letter to Norland, 
every thing was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so far settled in their future abode 
as to enable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters to 
begin their journey.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Many were the tears shed by them in 
their last</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">adieus to a place so much beloved.  
&quot;Dear, dear Norland!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Marianne, as she wandered alone 
before the house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the last evening of their being 
there; &quot;when shall I cease</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to regret you!--when learn to feel 
a home elsewhere!--Oh!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happy house, could you know what I 
suffer in now viewing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you from this spot, from whence perhaps 
I may view</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you no more!--And you, ye well-known 
trees!--but you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will continue the same.--No leaf will 
decay because we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are removed, nor any branch become 
motionless although we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can observe you no longer!--No; you 
will continue the same;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unconscious of the pleasure or the 
regret you occasion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and insensible of any change in those 
who walk under your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shade!--But who will remain to enjoy 
you?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 6</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The first part of their journey was 
performed in too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">melancholy a disposition to be otherwise 
than tedious</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and unpleasant.  But as they drew 
towards the end of it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their interest in the appearance of 
a country which they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were to inhabit overcame their dejection, 
and a view of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Barton Valley as they entered it gave 
them cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was a pleasant fertile spot, well 
wooded, and rich</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in pasture.  After winding along it 
for more than a mile,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they reached their own house.  A small 
green court was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the whole of its demesne in front; 
and a neat wicket gate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">admitted them into it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As a house, Barton Cottage, though 
small, was comfortable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and compact; but as a cottage it was 
defective, for the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">building was regular, the roof was 
tiled, the window</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shutters were not painted green, nor 
were the walls covered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with honeysuckles.  A narrow passage 
led directly through</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the house into the garden behind.  
On each side of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entrance was a sitting room, about 
sixteen feet square;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and beyond them were the offices and 
the stairs.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Four bed-rooms and two garrets formed 
the rest of the house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It had not been built many years and 
was in good repair.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In comparison of Norland, it was poor 
and small indeed!--but</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the tears which recollection called 
forth as they entered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the house were soon dried away.  They 
were cheered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the joy of the servants on their 
arrival, and each</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the sake of the others resolved 
to appear happy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was very early in September; the 
season was fine,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and from first seeing the place under 
the advantage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of good weather, they received an 
impression in its</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">favour which was of material service 
in recommending</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it to their lasting approbation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The situation of the house was good.  
High hills rose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately behind, and at no great 
distance on each side;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some of which were open downs, the 
others cultivated and woody.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The village of Barton was chiefly 
on one of these hills,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and formed a pleasant view from the 
cottage windows.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The prospect in front was more extensive; 
it commanded the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whole of the valley, and reached into 
the country beyond.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The hills which surrounded the cottage 
terminated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the valley in that direction; under 
another name,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in another course, it branched 
out again between two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the steepest of them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With the size and furniture of the 
house Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was upon the whole well satisfied; 
for though her former</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">style of life rendered many additions 
to the latter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indispensable, yet to add and improve 
was a delight to her;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she had at this time ready money 
enough to supply all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that was wanted of greater elegance 
to the apartments.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;As for the house itself, to 
be sure,&quot; said she, &quot;it is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too small for our family, but we will 
make ourselves</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tolerably comfortable for the present, 
as it is too late</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the year for improvements. Perhaps 
in the spring,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if I have plenty of money, as I dare 
say I shall, we may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think about building. These parlors 
are both too small</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for such parties of our friends as 
I hope to see often</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">collected here; and I have some thoughts 
of throwing the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">passage into one of them with perhaps 
a part of the other,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so leave the remainder of that 
other for an entrance;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this, with a new drawing room which 
may be easily added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a bed-chamber and garret above, 
will make it a very snug</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">little cottage.  I could wish the 
stairs were handsome.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But one must not expect every thing; 
though I suppose it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would be no difficult matter to widen 
them.  I shall see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how much I am before-hand with the 
world in the spring,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and we will plan our improvements 
accordingly.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In the mean time, till all these alterations 
could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be made from the savings of an income 
of five hundred</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a-year by a woman who never saved 
in her life, they were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wise enough to be contented with the 
house as it was;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and each of them was busy in arranging 
their particular</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">concerns, and endeavoring, by placing 
around them books</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and other possessions, to form themselves 
a home.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's pianoforte was unpacked 
and properly disposed of;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor's drawings were affixed 
to the walls of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sitting room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In such employments as these they 
were interrupted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">soon after breakfast the next day 
by the entrance of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their landlord, who called to welcome 
them to Barton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to offer them every accommodation 
from his own house</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and garden in which theirs might at 
present be deficient.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John Middleton was a good looking 
man about forty.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He had formerly visited at Stanhill, 
but it was too long</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for his young cousins to remember 
him.  His countenance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was thoroughly good-humoured; and 
his manners were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as friendly as the style of his letter.  
Their arrival</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed to afford him real satisfaction, 
and their comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be an object of real solicitude 
to him.  He said much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his earnest desire of their living 
in the most sociable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">terms with his family, and pressed 
them so cordially</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to dine at Barton Park every day till 
they were better</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">settled at home, that, though his 
entreaties were carried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to a point of perseverance beyond 
civility, they could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not give offence.  His kindness was 
not confined to words;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for within an hour after he left them, 
a large basket</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">full of garden stuff and fruit arrived 
from the park,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which was followed before the end 
of the day by a present</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of game.  He insisted, moreover, on 
conveying all their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">letters to and from the post for them, 
and would not be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">denied the satisfaction of sending 
them his newspaper</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton had sent a very civil 
message by him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">denoting her intention of waiting 
on Mrs. Dashwood as soon as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could be assured that her visit 
would be no inconvenience;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as this message was answered by 
an invitation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">equally polite, her ladyship was introduced 
to them the next day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were, of course, very anxious 
to see a person on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whom so much of their comfort at Barton 
must depend; and the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">elegance of her appearance was favourable 
to their wishes.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton was not more than six 
or seven and twenty;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her face was handsome, her figure 
tall and striking,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her address graceful. Her manners 
had all the elegance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which her husband's wanted.  But they 
would have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">improved by some share of his frankness 
and warmth;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her visit was long enough to detract 
something from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their first admiration, by shewing 
that, though perfectly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well-bred, she was reserved, cold, 
and had nothing to say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for herself beyond the most common-place 
inquiry or remark.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Conversation however was not wanted, 
for Sir John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was very chatty, and Lady Middleton 
had taken the wise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">precaution of bringing with her their 
eldest child, a fine</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">little boy about six years old, by 
which means there was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one subject always to be recurred 
to by the ladies in case</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of extremity, for they had to enquire 
his name and age,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">admire his beauty, and ask him questions 
which his mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">answered for him, while he hung about 
her and held</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">down his head, to the great surprise 
of her ladyship,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who wondered at his being so shy before 
company, as he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could make noise enough at home.  
On every formal visit</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a child ought to be of the party, 
by way of provision</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for discourse.  In the present case 
it took up ten minutes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to determine whether the boy were 
most like his father</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or mother, and in what particular 
he resembled either,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for of course every body differed, 
and every body was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">astonished at the opinion of the others.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">An opportunity was soon to be given 
to the Dashwoods</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of debating on the rest of the children, 
as Sir John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would not leave the house without 
securing their promise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of dining at the park the next day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 7</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Barton Park was about half a mile 
from the cottage.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The ladies had passed near it in their 
way along the valley,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it was screened from their view 
at home by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">projection of a hill.  The house was 
large and handsome;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the Middletons lived in a style 
of equal hospitality</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and elegance.  The former was for 
Sir John's gratification,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the latter for that of his lady.  
They were scarcely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ever without some friends staying 
with them in the house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and they kept more company of every 
kind than any other</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">family in the neighbourhood. It was 
necessary to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happiness of both; for however dissimilar 
in temper</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and outward behaviour, they strongly 
resembled each other</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in that total want of talent and taste 
which confined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their employments, unconnected with 
such as society produced,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">within a very narrow compass.  Sir 
John was a sportsman,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted 
and shot, and she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">humoured her children; and these were 
their only resources.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton had the advantage of 
being able to spoil her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">children all the year round, while 
Sir John's independent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">employments were in existence only 
half the time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Continual engagements at home and 
abroad, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">supplied all the deficiencies of nature 
and education;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">supported the good spirits of Sir 
John, and gave exercise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the good breeding of his wife.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton piqued herself upon 
the elegance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her table, and of all her domestic 
arrangements;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and from this kind of vanity was her 
greatest enjoyment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in any of their parties.  But Sir 
John's satisfaction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in society was much more real; he 
delighted in collecting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about him more young people than his 
house would hold,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the noisier they were the better 
was he pleased.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was a blessing to all the juvenile 
part of the neighbourhood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for in summer he was for ever forming 
parties to eat cold</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ham and chicken out of doors, and 
in winter his private</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">balls were numerous enough for any 
young lady who was not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suffering under the unsatiable appetite 
of fifteen.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The arrival of a new family in the 
country was always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a matter of joy to him, and in every 
point of view he was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">charmed with the inhabitants he had 
now procured for his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cottage at Barton.  The Miss Dashwoods 
were young, pretty,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and unaffected.  It was enough to 
secure his good opinion;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for to be unaffected was all that 
a pretty girl could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">want to make her mind as captivating 
as her person.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The friendliness of his disposition 
made him happy in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">accommodating those, whose situation 
might be considered,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in comparison with the past, as unfortunate.  
In showing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">kindness to his cousins therefore 
he had the real satisfaction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a good heart; and in settling a 
family of females only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction 
of a sportsman;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a sportsman, though he esteems 
only those of his sex who</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are sportsmen likewise, is not often 
desirous of encouraging</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their taste by admitting them to a 
residence within his own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">manor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were 
met at the door</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the house by Sir John, who welcomed 
them to Barton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Park with unaffected sincerity; and 
as he attended them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the drawing room repeated to the 
young ladies the concern</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which the same subject had drawn from 
him the day before,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at being unable to get any smart young 
men to meet them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They would see, he said, only one 
gentleman there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">besides himself; a particular friend 
who was staying at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the park, but who was neither very 
young nor very gay.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He hoped they would all excuse the 
smallness of the party,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and could assure them it should never 
happen so again.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He had been to several families that 
morning in hopes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of procuring some addition to their 
number, but it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was moonlight and every body was full 
of engagements.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had 
arrived at Barton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">within the last hour, and as she was 
a very cheerful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">agreeable woman, he hoped the young 
ladies would not find</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it so very dull as they might imagine.  
The young ladies,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as well as their mother, were perfectly 
satisfied with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">having two entire strangers of the 
party, and wished for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, 
was a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly 
woman, who talked a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great deal, seemed very happy, and 
rather vulgar. She was full</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of jokes and laughter, and before 
dinner was over had said</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">many witty things on the subject of 
lovers and husbands;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hoped they had not left their hearts 
behind them in Sussex,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and pretended to see them blush whether 
they did or not.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's 
sake, and turned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her eyes towards Elinor to see how 
she bore these attacks,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with an earnestness which gave Elinor 
far more pain than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could arise from such common-place 
raillery as Mrs. Jennings's.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir 
John, seemed no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more adapted by resemblance of manner 
to be his friend,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than Lady Middleton was to be his 
wife, or Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be Lady Middleton's mother. He 
was silent and grave.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His appearance however was not unpleasing, 
in spite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his being in the opinion of Marianne 
and Margaret</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an absolute old bachelor, for he was 
on the wrong side</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of five and thirty; but though his 
face was not handsome,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his countenance was sensible, and 
his address was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">particularly gentlemanlike.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">There was nothing in any of the party 
which could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">recommend them as companions to the 
Dashwoods; but the cold</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">insipidity of Lady Middleton was so 
particularly repulsive,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that in comparison of it the gravity 
of Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and even the boisterous mirth of Sir 
John and his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother-in-law was interesting.  Lady 
Middleton seemed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be roused to enjoyment only by 
the entrance of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">four noisy children after dinner, 
who pulled her about,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tore her clothes, and put an end to 
every kind of discourse</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">except what related to themselves.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In the evening, as Marianne was discovered 
to be musical,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was invited to play. The instrument 
was unlocked,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every body prepared to be charmed, 
and Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who sang very well, at their request 
went through the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">chief of the songs which Lady Middleton 
had brought into</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the family on her marriage, and which 
perhaps had lain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ever since in the same position on 
the pianoforte,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her ladyship had celebrated that 
event by giving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">up music, although by her mother's 
account, she had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">played extremely well, and by her 
own was very fond of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's performance was highly 
applauded.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John was loud in his admiration 
at the end of every song,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as loud in his conversation with 
the others while every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">song lasted.  Lady Middleton frequently 
called him to order,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wondered how any one's attention could 
be diverted from music</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a moment, and asked Marianne to 
sing a particular song</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which Marianne had just finished. Colonel 
Brandon alone,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all the party, heard her without 
being in raptures.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He paid her only the compliment of 
attention; and she felt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a respect for him on the occasion, 
which the others had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reasonably forfeited by their shameless 
want of taste.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His pleasure in music, though it amounted 
not to that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ecstatic delight which alone could 
sympathize with her own,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was estimable when contrasted against 
the horrible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">insensibility of the others; and she 
was reasonable enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to allow that a man of five and thirty 
might well have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">outlived all acuteness of feeling 
and every exquisite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">power of enjoyment.  She was perfectly 
disposed to make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every allowance for the colonel's 
advanced state of life</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which humanity required.</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 8</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an 
ample jointure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She had only two daughters, both of 
whom she had lived</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see respectably married, and she 
had now therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing to do but to marry all the 
rest of the world.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In the promotion of this object she 
was zealously active,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as far as her ability reached; and 
missed no opportunity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of projecting weddings among all the 
young people</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her acquaintance.  She was remarkably 
quick in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">discovery of attachments, and had 
enjoyed the advantage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of raising the blushes and the vanity 
of many a young</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lady by insinuations of her power 
over such a young man;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and this kind of discernment enabled 
her soon after her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce 
that Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon was very much in love with 
Marianne Dashwood.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She rather suspected it to be so, 
on the very first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">evening of their being together, from 
his listening</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so attentively while she sang to them; 
and when the visit</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was returned by the Middletons' dining 
at the cottage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the fact was ascertained by his listening 
to her again.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It must be so. She was perfectly convinced 
of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It would be an excellent match, for 
HE was rich, and SHE</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was handsome. Mrs. Jennings had been 
anxious to see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon well married, ever 
since her connection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with Sir John first brought him to 
her knowledge;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she was always anxious to get 
a good husband for every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pretty girl.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The immediate advantage to herself 
was by no means</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inconsiderable, for it supplied her 
with endless jokes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against them both.  At the park she 
laughed at the colonel,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in the cottage at Marianne. To 
the former her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">raillery was probably, as far as it 
regarded only himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perfectly indifferent; but to the 
latter it was at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">first incomprehensible; and when its 
object was understood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she hardly knew whether most to laugh 
at its absurdity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or censure its impertinence, for she 
considered it as an</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unfeeling reflection on the colonel's 
advanced years,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and on his forlorn condition as an 
old bachelor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think 
a man five years</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">younger than herself, so exceedingly 
ancient as he appeared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the youthful fancy of her daughter, 
ventured to clear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings from the probability 
of wishing to throw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ridicule on his age.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But at least, Mamma, you cannot 
deny the absurdity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the accusation, though you may 
not think it intentionally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ill-natured.  Colonel Brandon is certainly 
younger than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings, but he is old enough 
to be MY father;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if he were ever animated enough 
to be in love,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must have long outlived every sensation 
of the kind.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is too ridiculous!  When is a man 
to be safe from such wit,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if age and infirmity will not protect 
him?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Infirmity!&quot;said Elinor, 
&quot;do you call Colonel Brandon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">infirm?  I can easily suppose that 
his age may appear much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">greater to you than to my mother; 
but you can hardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">deceive yourself as to his having 
the use of his limbs!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did not you hear him complain 
of the rheumatism?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and is not that the commonest infirmity 
of declining life?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My dearest child,&quot;said 
her mother, laughing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;at this rate you must be in 
continual terror of MY decay;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it must seem to you a miracle 
that my life has been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">extended to the advanced age of forty.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mamma, you are not doing me 
justice.  I know very well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Colonel Brandon is not old enough 
to make his friends</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yet apprehensive of losing him in 
the course of nature.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He may live twenty years longer.  
But thirty-five has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing to do with matrimony.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Elinor,&quot;thirty-five 
and seventeen had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">better not have any thing to do with 
matrimony together.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But if there should by any chance 
happen to be a woman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who is single at seven and twenty, 
I should not think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon's being thirty-five 
any objection to his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">marrying HER.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;A woman of seven and twenty,&quot; 
said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after pausing a moment,&quot;can never 
hope to feel or inspire</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection again, and if her home be 
uncomfortable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or her fortune small, I can suppose 
that she might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bring herself to submit to the offices 
of a nurse,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the sake of the provision and 
security of a wife.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In his marrying such a woman therefore 
there would be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing unsuitable.  It would be a 
compact of convenience,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the world would be satisfied.  
In my eyes it would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be no marriage at all, but that would 
be nothing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To me it would seem only a commercial 
exchange, in which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">each wished to be benefited at the 
expense of the other.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It would be impossible, I know,&quot; 
replied Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;to convince you that a woman 
of seven and twenty could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feel for a man of thirty-five anything 
near enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to love, to make him a desirable companion 
to her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I must object to your dooming 
Colonel Brandon and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his wife to the constant confinement 
of a sick chamber,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">merely because he chanced to complain 
yesterday (a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic 
feel in one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his shoulders.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But he talked of flannel waistcoats,&quot; 
said Marianne;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;and with me a flannel waistcoat 
is invariably connected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with aches, cramps, rheumatisms, and 
every species of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ailment that can afflict the old and 
the feeble.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Had he been only in a violent 
fever, you would not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have despised him half so much. Confess, 
Marianne, is not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there something interesting to you 
in the flushed cheek,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Soon after this, upon Elinor's leaving 
the room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mamma,&quot; said Marianne, 
&quot;I have an alarm on the subject</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of illness which I cannot conceal 
from you.  I am sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward Ferrars is not well.  We have 
now been here almost</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a fortnight, and yet he does not come.  
Nothing but real</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indisposition could occasion this 
extraordinary delay.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What else can detain him at Norland?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Had you any idea of his coming 
so soon?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Mrs. Dashwood. &quot;I had none.  
On the contrary,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if I have felt any anxiety at all 
on the subject, it has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been in recollecting that he sometimes 
showed a want</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of pleasure and readiness in accepting 
my invitation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when I talked of his coming to Barton.  
Does Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expect him already?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have never mentioned it to 
her, but of course</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she must.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I rather think you are mistaken, 
for when I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was talking to her yesterday of getting 
a new grate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the spare bedchamber, she observed 
that there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was no immediate hurry for it, as 
it was not likely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that the room would be wanted for 
some time.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How strange this is! what can 
be the meaning of it!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But the whole of their behaviour to 
each other has been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unaccountable! How cold, how composed 
were their last</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">adieus! How languid their conversation 
the last evening</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their being together! In Edward's 
farewell there was no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">distinction between Elinor and me: 
it was the good wishes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of an affectionate brother to both.  
Twice did I leave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them purposely together in the course 
of the last morning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and each time did he most unaccountably 
follow me out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the room.  And Elinor, in quitting 
Norland and Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cried not as I did.  Even now her 
self-command is invariable.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When is she dejected or melancholy? 
When does she try</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to avoid society, or appear restless 
and dissatisfied</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in it?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 9</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Dashwoods were now settled at 
Barton with tolerable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comfort to themselves. The house and 
the garden, with all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the objects surrounding them, were 
now become familiar,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the ordinary pursuits which had 
given to Norland</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">half its charms were engaged in again 
with far greater</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enjoyment than Norland had been able 
to afford, since the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">loss of their father.  Sir John Middleton, 
who called</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on them every day for the first fortnight, 
and who was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not in the habit of seeing much occupation 
at home,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not conceal his amazement on 
finding them always employed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their visitors, except those from 
Barton Park,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were not many; for, in spite of Sir 
John's urgent entreaties</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that they would mix more in the neighbourhood, 
and repeated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assurances of his carriage being always 
at their service,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the independence of Mrs. Dashwood's 
spirit overcame the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wish of society for her children; 
and she was resolute</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in declining to visit any family beyond 
the distance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a walk.  There were but few who 
could be so classed;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it was not all of them that were 
attainable.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">About a mile and a half from the cottage, 
along the narrow</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">winding valley of Allenham, which 
issued from that of Barton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as formerly described, the girls had, 
in one of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">earliest walks, discovered an ancient 
respectable looking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mansion which, by reminding them a 
little of Norland,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">interested their imagination and made 
them wish to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">better acquainted with it.  But they 
learnt, on enquiry,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that its possessor, an elderly lady 
of very good character,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was unfortunately too infirm to mix 
with the world,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and never stirred from home.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The whole country about them abounded 
in beautiful walks.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The high downs which invited them 
from almost every window</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the cottage to seek the exquisite 
enjoyment of air</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on their summits, were a happy alternative 
when the dirt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the valleys beneath shut up their 
superior beauties;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and towards one of these hills did 
Marianne and Margaret</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one memorable morning direct their 
steps, attracted by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">partial sunshine of a showery sky, 
and unable longer to bear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the confinement which the settled 
rain of the two preceding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">days had occasioned.  The weather 
was not tempting enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to draw the two others from their 
pencil and their book,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in spite of Marianne's declaration 
that the day would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be lastingly fair, and that every 
threatening cloud would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be drawn off from their hills; and 
the two girls set off</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">together.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing 
in their own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">penetration at every glimpse of blue 
sky; and when they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">caught in their faces the animating 
gales of a high</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">south-westerly wind, they pitied the 
fears which had prevented</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their mother and Elinor from sharing 
such delightful sensations.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is there a felicity in the world,&quot; 
said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;superior to this?--Margaret, 
we will walk here at least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two hours.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Margaret agreed, and they pursued 
their way against</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the wind, resisting it with laughing 
delight for about</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">twenty minutes longer, when suddenly 
the clouds united over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their heads, and a driving rain set 
full in their face.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Chagrined and surprised, they were 
obliged, though unwillingly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to turn back, for no shelter was nearer 
than their own house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One consolation however remained for 
them, to which the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exigence of the moment gave more than 
usual propriety;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was that of running with all possible 
speed down the steep</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">side of the hill which led immediately 
to their garden gate.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They set off.  Marianne had at first 
the advantage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but a false step brought her suddenly 
to the ground;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Margaret, unable to stop herself 
to assist her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was involuntarily hurried along, and 
reached the bottom</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in safety.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A gentleman carrying a gun, with two 
pointers</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">playing round him, was passing up 
the hill and within</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a few yards of Marianne, when her 
accident happened.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He put down his gun and ran to her 
assistance. She had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">raised herself from the ground, but 
her foot had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">twisted in her fall, and she was scarcely 
able to stand.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The gentleman offered his services; 
and perceiving that her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">modesty declined what her situation 
rendered necessary,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">took her up in his arms without farther 
delay, and carried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her down the hill.  Then passing through 
the garden,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the gate of which had been left open 
by Margaret, he bore her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">directly into the house, whither Margaret 
was just arrived,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and quitted not his hold till he had 
seated her in a chair</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the parlour.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor and her mother rose up in amazement 
at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their entrance, and while the eyes 
of both were fixed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on him with an evident wonder and 
a secret admiration</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which equally sprung from his appearance, 
he apologized</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for his intrusion by relating its 
cause, in a manner</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so frank and so graceful that his 
person, which was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">uncommonly handsome, received additional 
charms from his voice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and expression.  Had he been even 
old, ugly, and vulgar,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. 
Dashwood would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been secured by any act of attention 
to her child;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the influence of youth, beauty, 
and elegance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gave an interest to the action which 
came home to her feelings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She thanked him again and again; and, 
with a sweetness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of address which always attended her, 
invited him to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be seated.  But this he declined, 
as he was dirty and wet.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know 
to whom she was obliged.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His name, he replied, was Willoughby, 
and his present</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">home was at Allenham, from whence 
he hoped she would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">allow him the honour of calling tomorrow 
to enquire</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after Miss Dashwood.  The honour was 
readily granted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he then departed, to make himself 
still more interesting,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the midst of an heavy rain.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His manly beauty and more than common 
gracefulness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were instantly the theme of general 
admiration,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the laugh which his gallantry 
raised against Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">received particular spirit from his 
exterior attractions.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne herself had seen less of 
his person that the rest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the confusion which crimsoned 
over her face, on his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lifting her up, had robbed her of 
the power of regarding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him after their entering the house.  
But she had seen</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enough of him to join in all the admiration 
of the others,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and with an energy which always adorned 
her praise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His person and air were equal to what 
her fancy had ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">drawn for the hero of a favourite 
story; and in his carrying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her into the house with so little 
previous formality, there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was a rapidity of thought which particularly 
recommended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the action to her.  Every circumstance 
belonging to him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was interesting.  His name was good, 
his residence was in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their favourite village, and she soon 
found out that of all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">manly dresses a shooting-jacket was 
the most becoming.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her imagination was busy, her reflections 
were pleasant,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the pain of a sprained ankle was 
disregarded.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John called on them as soon as 
the next interval</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of fair weather that morning allowed 
him to get out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of doors; and Marianne's accident 
being related to him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he was eagerly asked whether he knew 
any gentleman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Willoughby!&quot; cried Sir 
John; &quot;what, is HE</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the country? That is good news 
however; I will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ride over tomorrow, and ask him to 
dinner on Thursday.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You know him then,&quot; said 
Mrs. Dashwood.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Know him! to be sure I do.  
Why, he is down here</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every year.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And what sort of a young man 
is he?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;As good a kind of fellow as 
ever lived, I assure you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A very decent shot, and there is not 
a bolder rider</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in England.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And is that all you can say 
for him?&quot; cried Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indignantly.  &quot;But what are his 
manners on more intimate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acquaintance? What his pursuits, his 
talents, and genius?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John was rather puzzled.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon my soul,&quot; said he, 
&quot;I do not know much about him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as to all THAT.  But he is a pleasant, 
good humoured fellow,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and has got the nicest little black 
bitch of a pointer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I ever saw.  Was she out with him 
today?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Marianne could no more satisfy 
him as to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">colour of Mr. Willoughby's pointer, 
than he could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">describe to her the shades of his 
mind.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But who is he?&quot; said Elinor.  
&quot;Where does he come</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from?  Has he a house at Allenham?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On this point Sir John could give 
more certain intelligence;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he told them that Mr. Willoughby 
had no property</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his own in the country; that he 
resided there only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while he was visiting the old lady 
at Allenham Court,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to whom he was related, and whose 
possessions he was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to inherit; adding, &quot;Yes, yes, 
he is very well worth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">catching I can tell you, Miss Dashwood; 
he has a pretty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">little estate of his own in Somersetshire 
besides;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if I were you, I would not give 
him up to my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">younger sister, in spite of all this 
tumbling down hills.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Marianne must not expect to have 
all the men to herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon will be jealous, if she does 
not take care.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not believe,&quot; said 
Mrs. Dashwood, with a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good humoured smile, &quot;that Mr. 
Willoughby will be incommoded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the attempts of either of MY daughters 
towards what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you call CATCHING him.  It is not 
an employment to which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they have been brought up.  Men are 
very safe with us,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">let them be ever so rich.  I am glad 
to find, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from what you say, that he is a respectable 
young man,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and one whose acquaintance will not 
be ineligible.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He is as good a sort of fellow, 
I believe,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as ever lived,&quot; repeated Sir 
John.  &quot;I remember</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">last Christmas at a little hop at 
the park, he danced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from eight o'clock till four, without 
once sitting down.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did he indeed?&quot;cried Marianne 
with sparkling eyes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;and with elegance, with spirit?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes; and he was up again at 
eight to ride to covert.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is what I like; that is 
what a young man ought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be.  Whatever be his pursuits, 
his eagerness in them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should know no moderation, and leave 
him no sense of fatigue.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Aye, aye, I see how it will 
be,&quot; said Sir John, &quot;I see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how it will be.  You will be setting 
your cap at him now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and never think of poor Brandon.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is an expression, Sir John,&quot; 
said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">warmly, &quot;which I particularly 
dislike.  I abhor every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">common-place phrase by which wit is 
intended; and 'setting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one's cap at a man,' or 'making a 
conquest,' are the most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">odious of all.  Their tendency is 
gross and illiberal;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if their construction could ever 
be deemed clever,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time has long ago destroyed all its 
ingenuity.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John did not much understand this 
reproof;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but he laughed as heartily as if he 
did, and then replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ay, you will make conquests 
enough, I dare say,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one way or other.  Poor Brandon! he 
is quite smitten already,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he is very well worth setting 
your cap at, I can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tell you, in spite of all this tumbling 
about and spraining</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of ankles.&quot;</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's preserver, as Margaret, 
with more elegance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than precision, styled Willoughby, 
called at the cottage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">early the next morning to make his 
personal enquiries.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was received by Mrs. Dashwood with 
more than politeness;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a kindness which Sir John's account 
of him and her own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gratitude prompted; and every thing 
that passed during</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the visit tended to assure him of 
the sense, elegance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mutual affection, and domestic comfort 
of the family</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to whom accident had now introduced 
him.  Of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">personal charms he had not required 
a second interview</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be convinced.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">regular features, and a remarkably 
pretty figure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was still handsomer.  Her 
form, though not so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">correct as her sister's, in having 
the advantage of height,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was more striking; and her face was 
so lovely, that when </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the common cant of praise, she 
was called a beautiful girl,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">truth was less violently outraged 
than usually happens.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her skin was very brown, but, from 
its transparency,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her complexion was uncommonly brilliant; 
her features</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were all good; her smile was sweet 
and attractive;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in her eyes, which were very dark, 
there was a life,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a spirit, an eagerness, which could 
hardily be seen</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without delight.  From Willoughby 
their expression was at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">first held back, by the embarrassment 
which the remembrance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his assistance created.  But when 
this passed away,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when her spirits became collected, 
when she saw that to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perfect good-breeding of the gentleman, 
he united frankness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and vivacity, and above all, when 
she heard him declare,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that of music and dancing he was passionately 
fond,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she gave him such a look of approbation 
as secured the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">largest share of his discourse to 
herself for the rest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his stay.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was only necessary to mention any 
favourite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">amusement to engage her to talk.  
She could not be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">silent when such points were introduced, 
and she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had neither shyness nor reserve in 
their discussion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They speedily discovered that their 
enjoyment of dancing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and music was mutual, and that it 
arose from a general</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conformity of judgment in all that 
related to either.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Encouraged by this to a further examination 
of his opinions,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she proceeded to question him on the 
subject of books;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her favourite authors were brought 
forward and dwelt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">upon with so rapturous a delight, 
that any young man of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">five and twenty must have been insensible 
indeed, not to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">become an immediate convert to the 
excellence of such works,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however disregarded before.  Their 
taste was strikingly alike.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The same books, the same passages 
were idolized by each--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or if any difference appeared, any 
objection arose,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it lasted no longer than till the 
force of her arguments</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the brightness of her eyes could 
be displayed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He acquiesced in all her decisions, 
caught all her enthusiasm;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and long before his visit concluded, 
they conversed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the familiarity of a long-established 
acquaintance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, Marianne,&quot; said Elinor, 
as soon as he had left them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;for ONE morning I think you 
have done pretty well.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You have already ascertained Mr. Willoughby's 
opinion in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost every matter of importance.  
You know what he thinks</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Cowper and Scott; you are certain 
of his estimating</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their beauties as he ought, and you 
have received every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assurance of his admiring Pope no 
more than is proper.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But how is your acquaintance to be 
long supported, under such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">extraordinary despatch of every subject 
for discourse?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You will soon have exhausted each 
favourite topic.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Another meeting will suffice to explain 
his sentiments</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on picturesque beauty, and second 
marriages, and then</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you can have nothing farther to ask.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Elinor,&quot;cried Marianne, 
&quot;is this fair? is this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">just? are my ideas so scanty?  But 
I see what you mean.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have been too much at my ease, too 
happy, too frank.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have erred against every common-place 
notion of decorum;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have been open and sincere where 
I ought to have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been reserved, spiritless, dull, and 
deceitful--had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I talked only of the weather and the 
roads, and had I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spoken only once in ten minutes, this 
reproach would have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been spared.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My love,&quot; said her mother, 
&quot;you must not be offended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with Elinor--she was only in jest.  
I should scold</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her myself, if she were capable of 
wishing to check</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the delight of your conversation with 
our new friend.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was softened in a moment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby, on his side, gave every 
proof of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pleasure in their acquaintance, which 
an evident wish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of improving it could offer.  He came 
to them every day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To enquire after Marianne was at first 
his excuse; but the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">encouragement of his reception, to 
which every day gave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">greater kindness, made such an excuse 
unnecessary before it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had ceased to be possible, by Marianne's 
perfect recovery.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was confined for some days to 
the house; but never had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any confinement been less irksome. Willoughby 
was a young</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">man of good abilities, quick imagination, 
lively spirits,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and open, affectionate manners.  He 
was exactly formed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to engage Marianne's heart, for with 
all this, he joined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not only a captivating person, but 
a natural ardour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of mind which was now roused and increased 
by the example</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her own, and which recommended 
him to her affection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beyond every thing else.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His society became gradually her most 
exquisite enjoyment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They read, they talked, they sang 
together; his musical</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">talents were considerable; and he 
read with all the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sensibility and spirit which Edward 
had unfortunately wanted.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In Mrs. Dashwood's estimation he was 
as faultless</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as in Marianne's; and Elinor saw nothing 
to censure in him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but a propensity, in which he strongly 
resembled and peculiarly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">delighted her sister, of saying too 
much what he thought on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every occasion, without attention 
to persons or circumstances.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In hastily forming and giving his 
opinion of other people,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in sacrificing general politeness 
to the enjoyment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of undivided attention where his heart 
was engaged,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in slighting too easily the forms 
of worldly propriety,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he displayed a want of caution which 
Elinor could not approve,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in spite of all that he and Marianne 
could say in its support.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne began now to perceive that 
the desperation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which had seized her at sixteen and 
a half, of ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seeing a man who could satisfy her 
ideas of perfection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been rash and unjustifiable.  
Willoughby was all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that her fancy had delineated in that 
unhappy hour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in every brighter period, as capable 
of attaching her;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his behaviour declared his wishes 
to be in that respect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as earnest, as his abilities were 
strong.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her mother too, in whose mind not 
one speculative</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thought of their marriage had been 
raised, by his prospect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of riches, was led before the end 
of a week to hope and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expect it; and secretly to congratulate 
herself on having</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gained two such sons-in-law as Edward 
and Willoughby.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon's partiality for Marianne, 
which had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so early been discovered by his friends, 
now first became</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perceptible to Elinor, when it ceased 
to be noticed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by them.  Their attention and wit 
were drawn off to his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more fortunate rival; and the raillery 
which the other</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had incurred before any partiality 
arose, was removed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when his feelings began really to 
call for the ridicule</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so justly annexed to sensibility.  
Elinor was obliged,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though unwillingly, to believe that 
the sentiments which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings had assigned him for 
her own satisfaction,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were now actually excited by her sister; 
and that however</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a general resemblance of disposition 
between the parties</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might forward the affection of Mr. 
Willoughby, an equally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">striking opposition of character was 
no hindrance to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">regard of Colonel Brandon.  She saw 
it with concern;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for what could a silent man of five 
and thirty hope,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when opposed to a very lively one 
of five and twenty? and as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could not even wish him successful, 
she heartily wished</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him indifferent.  She liked him--in 
spite of his gravity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and reserve, she beheld in him an 
object of interest.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His manners, though serious, were 
mild; and his reserve</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">appeared rather the result of some 
oppression of spirits</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than of any natural gloominess of 
temper.  Sir John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had dropped hints of past injuries 
and disappointments,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which justified her belief of his 
being an unfortunate man,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she regarded him with respect 
and compassion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Perhaps she pitied and esteemed him 
the more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because he was slighted by Willoughby 
and Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who, prejudiced against him for being 
neither lively</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue 
his merits.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Brandon is just the kind of 
man,&quot; said Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one day, when they were talking of 
him together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;whom every body speaks well 
of, and nobody cares about;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whom all are delighted to see, and 
nobody remembers</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to talk to.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is exactly what I think 
of him,&quot;cried Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do not boast of it, however,&quot; 
said Elinor, &quot;for it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is injustice in both of you.  He is 
highly esteemed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by all the family at the park, and 
I never see him myself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without taking pains to converse with 
him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That he is patronised by YOU,&quot; 
replied Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;is certainly in his favour; 
but as for the esteem</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the others, it is a reproach in 
itself. Who would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">submit to the indignity of being approved 
by such a woman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, 
that could command</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the indifference of any body else?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But perhaps the abuse of such 
people as yourself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne will make amends for 
the regard of Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton and her mother.  If their 
praise is censure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your censure may be praise, for they 
are not more undiscerning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than you are prejudiced and unjust.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;In defence of your protege you 
can even be saucy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My protege, as you call him, 
is a sensible man;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sense will always have attractions 
for me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Yes, Marianne, even in a man between 
thirty and forty.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He has seen a great deal of the world; 
has been abroad,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has read, and has a thinking mind.  
I have found him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">capable of giving me much information 
on various subjects;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he has always answered my inquiries 
with readiness of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good-breeding and good nature.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is to say,&quot; cried 
Marianne contemptuously,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;he has told you, that in the 
East Indies the climate is hot,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the mosquitoes are troublesome.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He WOULD have told me so, I 
doubt not, had I made</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any such inquiries, but they happened 
to be points</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on which I had been previously informed.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Willoughby, 
&quot;his observations may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have extended to the existence of 
nabobs, gold mohrs,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and palanquins.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I may venture to say that HIS 
observations</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have stretched much further than your 
candour.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But why should you dislike him?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not dislike him.  I consider 
him, on the contrary,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as a very respectable man, who has 
every body's good word,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and nobody's notice; who, has more 
money than he can spend,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more time than he knows how to employ, 
and two new coats</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every year.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Add to which,&quot; cried Marianne, 
&quot;that he has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">neither genius, taste, nor spirit.  
That his understanding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has no brilliancy, his feelings no 
ardour, and his voice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no expression.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You decide on his imperfections 
so much in the mass,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">replied Elinor, &quot;and so much 
on the strength of your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">own imagination, that the commendation 
I am able to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of him is comparatively cold and insipid.  
I can only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pronounce him to be a sensible man, 
well-bred, well-informed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of gentle address, and, I believe, 
possessing an amiable heart.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Miss Dashwood,&quot; cried Willoughby, 
&quot;you are now using</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me unkindly.  You are endeavouring 
to disarm me by reason,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to convince me against my will.  
But it will not do.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You shall find me as stubborn as you 
can be artful.  I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">three unanswerable reasons for disliking 
Colonel Brandon;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he threatened me with rain when I 
wanted it to be fine;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he has found fault with the hanging 
of my curricle,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I cannot persuade him to buy my 
brown mare.  If it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will be any satisfaction to you, however, 
to be told,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that I believe his character to be 
in other respects</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">irreproachable, I am ready to confess 
it.  And in return</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for an acknowledgment, which must 
give me some pain,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you cannot deny me the privilege of 
disliking him as much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as ever.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her daughters 
imagined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when they first came into Devonshire, 
that so many</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">engagements would arise to occupy 
their time as shortly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">presented themselves, or that they 
should have such frequent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">invitations and such constant visitors 
as to leave them little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">leisure for serious employment. Yet 
such was the case.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When Marianne was recovered, the schemes 
of amusement at home</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and abroad, which Sir John had been 
previously forming,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were put into execution. The private 
balls at the park</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">then began; and parties on the water 
were made and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">accomplished as often as a showery 
October would allow.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In every meeting of the kind Willoughby 
was included;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the ease and familiarity which 
naturally attended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">these parties were exactly calculated 
to give increasing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intimacy to his acquaintance with 
the Dashwoods, to afford</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him opportunity of witnessing the 
excellencies of Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of marking his animated admiration 
of her, and of receiving,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her behaviour to himself, the most 
pointed assurance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her affection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not be surprised at their 
attachment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She only wished that it were less 
openly shewn; and once</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or twice did venture to suggest the 
propriety of some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">self-command to Marianne.  But Marianne 
abhorred all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">concealment where no real disgrace 
could attend unreserve;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to aim at the restraint of sentiments 
which were not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in themselves illaudable, appeared 
to her not merely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful 
subjection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of reason to common-place and mistaken 
notions.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby thought the same; and their 
behaviour at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all times, was an illustration of 
their opinions.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When he was present she had no eyes 
for any one else.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Every thing he did, was right.  Every 
thing he said, was clever.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If their evenings at the park were 
concluded with cards,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he cheated himself and all the rest 
of the party to get</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her a good hand.  If dancing formed 
the amusement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the night, they were partners for 
half the time;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and when obliged to separate for a 
couple of dances,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were careful to stand together and 
scarcely spoke a word</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to any body else.  Such conduct made 
them of course</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule 
could not shame,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and seemed hardly to provoke them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their 
feelings with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a warmth which left her no inclination 
for checking this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">excessive display of them.  To her 
it was but the natural</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">consequence of a strong affection 
in a young and ardent mind.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This was the season of happiness to 
Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her heart was devoted to Willoughby, 
and the fond attachment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Norland, which she brought with 
her from Sussex,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was more likely to be softened than 
she had thought it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possible before, by the charms which 
his society bestowed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her present home.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's happiness was not so great.  
Her heart was not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so much at ease, nor her satisfaction 
in their amusements</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so pure.  They afforded her no companion 
that could make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">amends for what she had left behind, 
nor that could teach</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her to think of Norland with less 
regret than ever.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Neither Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings 
could supply</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her the conversation she missed; 
although the latter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was an everlasting talker, and from 
the first had regarded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her with a kindness which ensured 
her a large share of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her discourse.  She had already repeated 
her own history</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Elinor three or four times; and 
had Elinor's memory been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">equal to her means of improvement, 
she might have known</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very early in their acquaintance all 
the particulars of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Jenning's last illness, and what 
he said to his wife</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a few minutes before he died.  Lady 
Middleton was more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">agreeable than her mother only in 
being more silent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor needed little observation to 
perceive that her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reserve was a mere calmness of manner 
with which sense</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had nothing to do.  Towards her husband 
and mother she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was the same as to them; and intimacy 
was therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">neither to be looked for nor desired.  
She had nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to say one day that she had not said 
the day before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her insipidity was invariable, for 
even her spirits were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">always the same; and though she did 
not oppose the parties</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">arranged by her husband, provided 
every thing were conducted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in style and her two eldest children 
attended her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she never appeared to receive more 
enjoyment from them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than she might have experienced in 
sitting at home;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so little did her presence add 
to the pleasure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the others, by any share in their 
conversation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that they were sometimes only reminded 
of her being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">amongst them by her solicitude about 
her troublesome boys.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her 
new acquaintance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">did Elinor find a person who could 
in any degree claim the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">respect of abilities, excite the interest 
of friendship,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or give pleasure as a companion.  
Willoughby was out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the question.  Her admiration and 
regard, even her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sisterly regard, was all his own; 
but he was a lover;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his attentions were wholly Marianne's, 
and a far less</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">agreeable man might have been more 
generally pleasing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for 
himself, had no such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">encouragement to think only of Marianne, 
and in conversing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with Elinor he found the greatest 
consolation for the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indifference of her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's compassion for him increased, 
as she had reason</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to suspect that the misery of disappointed 
love had already</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been known to him.  This suspicion 
was given by some words</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which accidently dropped from him 
one evening at the park,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when they were sitting down together 
by mutual consent,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while the others were dancing.  His 
eyes were fixed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on Marianne, and, after a silence 
of some minutes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he said, with a faint smile, &quot;Your 
sister, I understand,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">does not approve of second attachments.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No,&quot; replied Elinor, &quot;her 
opinions are all romantic.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Or rather, as I believe, she 
considers them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">impossible to exist.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I believe she does.  But how 
she contrives it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without reflecting on the character 
of her own father,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who had himself two wives, I know 
not.  A few years</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however will settle her opinions on 
the reasonable basis</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of common sense and observation; and 
then they may be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more easy to define and to justify 
than they now are,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by any body but herself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;This will probably be the case,&quot; 
he replied;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;and yet there is something so 
amiable in the prejudices</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a young mind, that one is sorry 
to see them give way</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the reception of more general opinions.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I cannot agree with you there,&quot; 
said Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There are inconveniences attending 
such feelings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as Marianne's, which all the charms 
of enthusiasm and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ignorance of the world cannot atone 
for.  Her systems have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all the unfortunate tendency of setting 
propriety at nought;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a better acquaintance with the 
world is what I look</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">forward to as her greatest possible 
advantage.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After a short pause he resumed the 
conversation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by saying,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Does your sister make no distinction 
in her objections</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against a second attachment? or is 
it equally criminal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in every body? Are those who have 
been disappointed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in their first choice, whether from 
the inconstancy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of its object, or the perverseness 
of circumstances,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be equally indifferent during the 
rest of their lives?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon my word, I am not acquainted 
with the minutiae</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her principles.  I only know that 
I never yet heard her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">admit any instance of a second attachment's 
being pardonable.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;This,&quot; said he,&quot;cannot 
hold; but a change,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a total change of sentiments--No, 
no, do not desire it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for when the romantic refinements 
of a young mind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are obliged to give way, how frequently 
are they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">succeeded by such opinions as are 
but too common, and too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dangerous! I speak from experience.  
I once knew a lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who in temper and mind greatly resembled 
your sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who thought and judged like her, but 
who from an inforced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">change--from a series of unfortunate 
circumstances&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Here he stopt suddenly; appeared to 
think that he had said</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too much, and by his countenance gave 
rise to conjectures,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which might not otherwise have entered 
Elinor's head.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The lady would probably have passed 
without suspicion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had he not convinced Miss Dashwood 
that what concerned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her ought not to escape his lips.  
As it was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it required but a slight effort of 
fancy to connect his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">emotion with the tender recollection 
of past regard.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor attempted no more.  But Marianne, 
in her place,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would not have done so little.  The 
whole story would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been speedily formed under her 
active imagination;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and every thing established in the 
most melancholy order</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of disastrous love.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 12</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As Elinor and Marianne were walking 
together the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">next morning the latter communicated 
a piece of news</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her sister, which in spite of all 
that she knew</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before of Marianne's imprudence and 
want of thought,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">surprised her by its extravagant testimony 
of both.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne told her, with the greatest 
delight, that </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby had given her a horse, 
one that he had bred</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">himself on his estate in Somersetshire, 
and which was </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exactly calculated to carry a woman.  
Without considering </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that it was not in her mother's plan 
to keep any horse,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that if she were to alter her resolution 
in favour of </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this gift, she must buy another for 
the servant, and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">keep a servant to ride it, and after 
all, build a stable </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to receive them, she had accepted 
the present without </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hesitation, and told her sister of 
it in raptures.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He intends to send his groom 
into Somersetshire</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately for it,&quot; she added, 
&quot;and when it arrives we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will ride every day.  You shall share 
its use with me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, 
the delight of a gallop</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on some of these downs.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Most unwilling was she to awaken from 
such a dream of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">felicity to comprehend all the unhappy 
truths which attended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the affair; and for some time she 
refused to submit to them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As to an additional servant, the expense 
would be a trifle;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mamma she was sure would never object 
to it; and any horse</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would do for HIM; he might always 
get one at the park;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as to a stable, the merest shed would 
be sufficient.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor then ventured to doubt the 
propriety of her receiving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such a present from a man so little, 
or at least so lately</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">known to her.  This was too much.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are mistaken, Elinor,&quot; 
said she warmly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;in supposing I know very little 
of Willoughby.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have not known him long indeed, 
but I am much better</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acquainted with him, than I am with 
any other creature</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world, except yourself and 
mama.  It is not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time or opportunity that is to determine 
intimacy;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it is disposition alone.  Seven years 
would be insufficient</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make some people acquainted with 
each other, and seven</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">days are more than enough for others.  
I should hold</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself guilty of greater impropriety 
in accepting a horse</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from my brother, than from Willoughby.  
Of John I know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very little, though we have lived 
together for years;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but of Willoughby my judgment has 
long been formed.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor thought it wisest to touch 
that point no more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She knew her sister's temper.  Opposition 
on so tender a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subject would only attach her the 
more to her own opinion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But by an appeal to her affection 
for her mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by representing the inconveniences 
which that indulgent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother must draw on herself, if (as 
would probably be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the case) she consented to this increase 
of establishment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was shortly subdued; and 
she promised not to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tempt her mother to such imprudent 
kindness by mentioning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the offer, and to tell Willoughby 
when she saw him next,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that it must be declined.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was faithful to her word; and 
when Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">called at the cottage, the same day, 
Elinor heard her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">express her disappointment to him 
in a low voice, on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being obliged to forego the acceptance 
of his present.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The reasons for this alteration were 
at the same time related,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and they were such as to make further 
entreaty on his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">side impossible. His concern however 
was very apparent;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and after expressing it with earnestness, 
he added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the same low voice,--&quot;But, 
Marianne, the horse is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">still yours, though you cannot use 
it now.  I shall keep</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it only till you can claim it.  When 
you leave Barton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to form your own establishment in 
a more lasting home,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Queen Mab shall receive you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; 
and in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whole of the sentence, in his manner 
of pronouncing it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in his addressing her sister by 
her christian name alone,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, 
a meaning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so direct, as marked a perfect agreement 
between them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&gt;From that moment she doubted not 
of their being engaged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to each other; and the belief of it 
created no other surprise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than that she, or any of their friends, 
should be left</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by tempers so frank, to discover it 
by accident.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Margaret related something to her 
the next day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which placed this matter in a still 
clearer light.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby had spent the preceding 
evening with them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Margaret, by being left some time 
in the parlour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with only him and Marianne, had had 
opportunity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for observations, which, with a most 
important face,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she communicated to her eldest sister, 
when they were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">next by themselves.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, Elinor!&quot; she cried, 
&quot;I have such a secret to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tell you about Marianne. I am sure 
she will be married</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Mr. Willoughby very soon.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You have said so,&quot; replied 
Elinor,&quot;almost every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">day since they first met on High-church 
Down; and they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had not known each other a week, I 
believe, before you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were certain that Marianne wore his 
picture round her neck;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it turned out to be only the miniature 
of our great uncle.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But indeed this is quite another 
thing.  I am sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they will be married very soon, for 
he has got a lock</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her hair.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Take care, Margaret.  It may 
be only the hair</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of some great uncle of HIS.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. 
I am almost</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sure it is, for I saw him cut it off.  
Last night</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after tea, when you and mama went 
out of the room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they were whispering and talking together 
as fast as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could be, and he seemed to be begging 
something of her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and presently he took up her scissors 
and cut off a long</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled 
down her back;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he kissed it, and folded it up 
in a piece of white paper;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and put it into his pocket-book.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">For such particulars, stated on such 
authority,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not withhold her credit; 
nor was she disposed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to it, for the circumstance was in 
perfect unison with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what she had heard and seen herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Margaret's sagacity was not always 
displayed in a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">way so satisfactory to her sister.  
When Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attacked her one evening at the park, 
to give the name</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the young man who was Elinor's 
particular favourite,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which had been long a matter of great 
curiosity to her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Margaret answered by looking at her 
sister, and saying,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I must not tell, may I, Elinor?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This of course made every body laugh; 
and Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tried to laugh too. But the effort 
was painful.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was convinced that Margaret had 
fixed on a person</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whose name she could not bear with 
composure to become</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne felt for her most sincerely; 
but she did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more harm than good to the cause, 
by turning very red</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and saying in an angry manner to Margaret,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Remember that whatever your 
conjectures may be,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you have no right to repeat them.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I never had any conjectures 
about it,&quot;replied Margaret;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;it was you who told me of it 
yourself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This increased the mirth of the company, 
and Margaret</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was eagerly pressed to say something 
more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let 
us know all about it,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Mrs. Jennings. &quot;What is 
the gentleman's name?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I must not tell, ma'am. But 
I know very well what it is;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I know where he is too.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, yes, we can guess where 
he is; at his own house</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Norland to be sure.  He is the 
curate of the parish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I dare say.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, THAT he is not.  He is of 
no profession at all.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Margaret,&quot; said Marianne 
with great warmth,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;you know that all this is an 
invention of your own,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that there is no such person in 
existence.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, then, he is lately dead, 
Marianne, for I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">am sure there was such a man once, 
and his name begins</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with an F.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady 
Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for observing, at this moment, &quot;that 
it rained very hard,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though she believed the interruption 
to proceed less from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any attention to her, than from her 
ladyship's great dislike</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all such inelegant subjects of 
raillery as delighted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her husband and mother.  The idea 
however started by her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was immediately pursued by Colonel 
Brandon, who was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on every occasion mindful of the feelings 
of others;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and much was said on the subject of 
rain by both of them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby opened the piano-forte, 
and asked Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to sit down to it; and thus amidst 
the various endeavours</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of different people to quit the topic, 
it fell to the ground.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But not so easily did Elinor recover 
from the alarm into</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which it had thrown her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A party was formed this evening for 
going on the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">following day to see a very fine place 
about twelve miles</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law 
of Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without whose interest it could not 
be seen, as the proprietor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who was then abroad, had left strict 
orders on that head.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The grounds were declared to be highly 
beautiful,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Sir John, who was particularly 
warm in their praise,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might be allowed to be a tolerable 
judge, for he had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">formed parties to visit them, at least, 
twice every summer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the last ten years.  They contained 
a noble piece</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of water; a sail on which was to a 
form a great part of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the morning's amusement; cold provisions 
were to be taken,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">open carriages only to be employed, 
and every thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conducted in the usual style of a 
complete party of pleasure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To some few of the company it appeared 
rather</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a bold undertaking, considering the 
time of year,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that it had rained every day for 
the last fortnight;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already 
a cold, was persuaded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Elinor to stay at home.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 13</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their intended excursion to Whitwell 
turned out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very different from what Elinor had 
expected. She was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">prepared to be wet through, fatigued, 
and frightened;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the event was still more unfortunate, 
for they did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not go at all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">By ten o'clock the whole party was 
assembled at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the park, where they were to breakfast.  
The morning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was rather favourable, though it had 
rained all night,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the clouds were then dispersing 
across the sky,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the sun frequently appeared.  
They were all in high</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spirits and good humour, eager to 
be happy, and determined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to submit to the greatest inconveniences 
and hardships</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rather than be otherwise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">While they were at breakfast the letters 
were brought in.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Among the rest there was one for Colonel 
Brandon;--he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">took it, looked at the direction, 
changed colour,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and immediately left the room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What is the matter with Brandon?&quot; 
said Sir John.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nobody could tell.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I hope he has had no bad news,&quot; 
said Lady Middleton.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It must be something extraordinary 
that could make Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon leave my breakfast table so 
suddenly.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In about five minutes he returned.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No bad news, Colonel, I hope;&quot; 
said Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as he entered the room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;None at all, ma'am, I thank 
you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Was it from Avignon?  I hope 
it is not to say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that your sister is worse.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, ma'am. It came from town, 
and is merely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a letter of business.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But how came the hand to discompose 
you so much,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if it was only a letter of business?  
Come, come,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this won't do, Colonel; so let us 
hear the truth of it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My dear madam,&quot; said Lady 
Middleton, &quot;recollect what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you are saying.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps it is to tell you that 
your cousin Fanny</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is married?&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, 
without attending</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her daughter's reproof.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, indeed, it is not.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, then, I know who it is 
from, Colonel. And I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hope she is well.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Whom do you mean, ma'am?&quot; 
said he, colouring a little.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! you know who I mean.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am particularly sorry, ma'am,&quot; 
said he,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">addressing Lady Middleton, &quot;that 
I should receive this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">letter today, for it is on business 
which requires</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my immediate attendance in town.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;In town!&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings.  
&quot;What can you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have to do in town at this time of 
year?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My own loss is great,&quot; 
be continued, &quot;in being obliged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to leave so agreeable a party; but 
I am the more concerned,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as I fear my presence is necessary 
to gain your admittance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Whitwell.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What a blow upon them all was this!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But if you write a note to the 
housekeeper, Mr. Brandon,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Marianne, eagerly, &quot;will 
it not be sufficient?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He shook his head.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We must go,&quot; said Sir John.--&quot;It 
shall not be put</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">off when we are so near it.  You cannot 
go to town till</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tomorrow, Brandon, that is all.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I wish it could be so easily 
settled.  But it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is not in my power to delay my journey 
for one day!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If you would but let us know 
what your business is,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Mrs. Jennings,&quot;we might 
see whether it could be put</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">off or not.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You would not be six hours later,&quot; 
said Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;if you were to defer your journey 
till our return.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I cannot afford to lose ONE 
hour.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor then heard Willoughby say, 
in a low voice to Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There are some people who cannot 
bear a party of pleasure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon is one of them. He was afraid 
of catching cold</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I dare say, and invented this trick 
for getting out of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I would lay fifty guineas the letter 
was of his own writing.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have no doubt of it,&quot; 
replied Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There is no persuading you to 
change your mind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon, I know of old,&quot; said 
Sir John, &quot;when once you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are determined on anything. But, however, 
I hope you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will think better of it.  Consider, 
here are the two Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Careys come over from Newton, the 
three Miss Dashwoods</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">walked up from the cottage, and Mr. 
Willoughby got up</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two hours before his usual time, on 
purpose to go to Whitwell.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon again repeated his 
sorrow at being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the cause of disappointing the party; 
but at the same</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time declared it to be unavoidable.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, then, when will you come 
back again?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I hope we shall see you at Barton,&quot; 
added her ladyship,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;as soon as you can conveniently 
leave town; and we must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">put off the party to Whitwell till 
you return.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are very obliging.  But 
it is so uncertain,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when I may have it in my power to 
return, that I dare</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not engage for it at all.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! he must and shall come back,&quot; 
cried Sir John.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If he is not here by the end 
of the week, I shall go</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ay, so do, Sir John,&quot; cried 
Mrs. Jennings, &quot;and then</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perhaps you may find out what his 
business is.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not want to pry into other 
men's concerns.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I suppose it is something he is ashamed 
of.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon's horses were announced.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You do not go to town on horseback, 
do you?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">added Sir John.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No. Only to Honiton.  I shall 
then go post.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, as you are resolved to 
go, I wish you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a good journey.  But you had better 
change your mind.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I assure you it is not in my 
power.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He then took leave of the whole party.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is there no chance of my seeing 
you and your sisters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in town this winter, Miss Dashwood?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am afraid, none at all.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Then I must bid you farewell 
for a longer time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than I should wish to do.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To Marianne, he merely bowed and said 
nothing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Come Colonel,&quot; said Mrs. 
Jennings, &quot;before you go,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">do let us know what you are going 
about.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He wished her a good morning, and, 
attended by Sir John,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">left the room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The complaints and lamentations which 
politeness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had hitherto restrained, now burst 
forth universally;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and they all agreed again and again 
how provoking it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be so disappointed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I can guess what his business 
is, however,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Mrs. Jennings exultingly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Can you, ma'am?&quot; said almost 
every body.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes; it is about Miss Williams, 
I am sure.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And who is Miss Williams?&quot; 
asked Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What! do not you know who Miss 
Williams is? I am</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sure you must have heard of her before.  
She is a relation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the Colonel's, my dear; a very 
near relation.  We will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not say how near, for fear of shocking 
the young ladies.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Then, lowering her voice a little, 
she said to Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She is his natural daughter.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, yes; and as like him as 
she can stare.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I dare say the Colonel will leave 
her all his fortune.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When Sir John returned, he joined 
most heartily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the general regret on so unfortunate 
an event;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">concluding however by observing, that 
as they were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all got together, they must do something 
by way of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being happy; and after some consultation 
it was agreed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that although happiness could only 
be enjoyed at Whitwell,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they might procure a tolerable composure 
of mind by driving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about the country.  The carriages 
were then ordered;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby's was first, and Marianne 
never looked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happier than when she got into it.  
He drove through</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the park very fast, and they were 
soon out of sight;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and nothing more of them was seen 
till their return,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which did not happen till after the 
return of all the rest.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They both seemed delighted with their 
drive; but said</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only in general terms that they had 
kept in the lanes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while the others went on the downs.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was settled that there should be 
a dance in the evening,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that every body should be extremely 
merry all day long.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Some more of the Careys came to dinner, 
and they had the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pleasure of sitting down nearly twenty 
to table, which Sir</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">John observed with great contentment.  
Willoughby took</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his usual place between the two elder 
Miss Dashwoods.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor's right 
hand; and they had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been long seated, before she leant 
behind her and Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and said to Marianne, loud enough 
for them both to hear,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have found you out in spite 
of all your tricks.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I know where you spent the morning.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne coloured, and replied very 
hastily,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Where, pray?&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did not you know,&quot; said 
Willoughby, &quot;that we had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been out in my curricle?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know 
that very well,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I was determined to find out WHERE 
you had been to.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I hope you like your house, Miss Marianne. It 
is a very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">large one, I know; and when I come 
to see you, I hope you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will have new-furnished it, for it 
wanted it very much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when I was there six years ago.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne turned away in great confusion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings laughed heartily; and 
Elinor found that in her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">resolution to know where they had 
been, she had actually</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made her own woman enquire of Mr. 
Willoughby's groom;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that she had by that method been 
informed that they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had gone to Allenham, and spent a 
considerable time there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in walking about the garden and going 
all over the house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could hardly believe this to 
be true,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as it seemed very unlikely that Willoughby 
should propose,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or Marianne consent, to enter the 
house while Mrs. Smith was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in it, with whom Marianne had not 
the smallest acquaintance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As soon as they left the dining-room, 
Elinor enquired</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her about it; and great was her 
surprise when she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">found that every circumstance related 
by Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was perfectly true.  Marianne was 
quite angry with her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for doubting it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why should you imagine, Elinor, 
that we did not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">go there, or that we did not see the 
house?  Is not it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what you have often wished to do yourself?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, Marianne, but I would not 
go while Mrs. Smith</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was there, and with no other companion 
than Mr. Willoughby.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mr. Willoughby however is the 
only person who can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have a right to shew that house; and 
as he went in an open</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">carriage, it was impossible to have 
any other companion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I never spent a pleasanter morning 
in my life.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am afraid,&quot; replied Elinor, 
&quot;that the pleasantness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of an employment does not always evince 
its propriety.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;On the contrary, nothing can 
be a stronger proof</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it, Elinor; for if there had been 
any real impropriety</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in what I did, I should have been 
sensible of it at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the time, for we always know when 
we are acting wrong,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and with such a conviction I could 
have had no pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But, my dear Marianne, as it 
has already exposed you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to some very impertinent remarks, 
do you not now begin</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to doubt the discretion of your own 
conduct?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If the impertinent remarks of 
Mrs. Jennings are</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be the proof of impropriety in 
conduct, we are all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">offending every moment of our lives.  
I value not her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">censure any more than I should do 
her commendation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am not sensible of having done anything 
wrong in walking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">over Mrs. Smith's grounds, or in seeing 
her house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They will one day be Mr. Willoughby's, 
and--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If they were one day to be your 
own, Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you would not be justified in what 
you have done.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She blushed at this hint; but it was 
even visibly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gratifying to her; and after a ten 
minutes' interval of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">earnest thought, she came to her sister 
again, and said</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with great good humour, &quot;Perhaps, 
Elinor, it WAS rather</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; 
but Mr. Willoughby wanted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">particularly to shew me the place; 
and it is a charming house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I assure you.--There is one remarkably 
pretty sitting room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">up stairs; of a nice comfortable size 
for constant use,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and with modern furniture it would 
be delightful.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is a corner room, and has windows 
on two sides.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On one side you look across the bowling-green, 
behind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the house, to a beautiful hanging 
wood, and on the other you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have a view of the church and village, 
and, beyond them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of those fine bold hills that we have 
so often admired.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I did not see it to advantage, for 
nothing could be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more forlorn than the furniture,--but 
if it were newly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fitted up--a couple of hundred pounds, 
Willoughby says,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would make it one of the pleasantest 
summer-rooms</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in England.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Could Elinor have listened to her 
without interruption</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the others, she would have described 
every room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the house with equal delight.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 14</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The sudden termination of Colonel 
Brandon's visit</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the park, with his steadiness in 
concealing its cause,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">filled the mind, and raised the wonder 
of Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for two or three days; she was a great 
wonderer, as every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one must be who takes a very lively 
interest in all the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comings and goings of all their acquaintance.  
She wondered,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with little intermission what could 
be the reason of it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was sure there must be some bad news, 
and thought over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every kind of distress that could 
have befallen him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a fixed determination that he 
should not escape</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Something very melancholy must 
be the matter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure,&quot; said she.  &quot;I 
could see it in his face.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor man!  I am afraid his circumstances 
may be bad.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The estate at Delaford was never reckoned 
more than two thousand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a year, and his brother left everything 
sadly involved.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I do think he must have been sent 
for about money matters,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for what else can it be?  I wonder 
whether it is so.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I would give anything to know the 
truth of it. Perhaps it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is about Miss Williams and, by the 
bye, I dare say it is,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because he looked so conscious when 
I mentioned her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">May be she is ill in town; nothing 
in the world more likely,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I have a notion she is always 
rather sickly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I would lay any wager it is about 
Miss Williams.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is not so very likely he should 
be distressed in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his circumstances NOW, for he is a 
very prudent man,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to be sure must have cleared the 
estate by this time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I wonder what it can be!  May be his 
sister is worse</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Avignon, and has sent for him over.  
His setting off</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, 
I wish him out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all his trouble with all my heart, 
and a good wife into</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the bargain.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings.  
Her opinion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">varying with every fresh conjecture, 
and all seeming</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">equally probable as they arose.  Elinor, 
though she felt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">really interested in the welfare of 
Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not bestow all the wonder on 
his going so suddenly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">away, which Mrs. Jennings was desirous 
of her feeling;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for besides that the circumstance 
did not in her opinion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">justify such lasting amazement or 
variety of speculation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her wonder was otherwise disposed 
of.  It was engossed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the extraordinary silence of her 
sister and Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the subject, which they must know 
to be peculiarly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">interesting to them all.  As this 
silence continued,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every day made it appear more strange 
and more incompatible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the disposition of both.  Why 
they should not openly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acknowledge to her mother and herself, 
what their constant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaviour to each other declared to 
have taken place,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not imagine.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She could easily conceive that marriage 
might not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be immediately in their power; for 
though Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was independent, there was no reason 
to believe him rich.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His estate had been rated by Sir John 
at about six or seven</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hundred a year; but he lived at an 
expense to which that income</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could hardly be equal, and he had 
himself often complained</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his poverty.  But for this strange 
kind of secrecy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">maintained by them relative to their 
engagement, which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in fact concealed nothing at all, 
she could not account;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it was so wholly contradictory 
to their general</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opinions and practice, that a doubt 
sometimes entered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her mind of their being really engaged, 
and this doubt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was enough to prevent her making any 
inquiry of Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nothing could be more expressive of 
attachment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to them all, than Willoughby's behaviour.  
To Marianne </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it had all the distinguishing tenderness 
which a lover's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">heart could give, and to the rest 
of the family it was the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affectionate attention of a son and 
a brother.  The cottage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed to be considered and loved 
by him as his home;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">many more of his hours were spent 
there than at Allenham;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if no general engagement collected 
them at the park,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the exercise which called him out 
in the morning was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost certain of ending there, where 
the rest of the day</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was spent by himself at the side of 
Marianne, and by his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">favourite pointer at her feet.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One evening in particular, about a 
week after</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon left the country, 
his heart seemed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more than usually open to every feeling 
of attachment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the objects around him; and on 
Mrs. Dashwood's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happening to mention her design of 
improving the cottage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the spring, he warmly opposed every 
alteration</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a place which affection had established 
as perfect with him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What!&quot; he exclaimed--&quot;Improve 
this dear cottage!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No. THAT I will never consent to.  
Not a stone must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be added to its walls, not an inch 
to its size,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if my feelings are regarded.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do not be alarmed,&quot; said 
Miss Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;nothing of the kind will be 
done; for my mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will never have money enough to attempt 
it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am heartily glad of it&quot;, 
he cried. &quot;May she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">always be poor, if she can employ 
her riches no better.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Thank you, Willoughby.  But 
you may be assured that I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would not sacrifice one sentiment 
of local attachment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of yours, or of any one whom I loved, 
for all the improvements</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world. Depend upon it that 
whatever unemployed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sum may remain, when I make up my 
accounts in the spring,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I would even rather lay it uselessly 
by than dispose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it in a manner so painful to you.  
But are you really</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so attached to this place as to see 
no defect in it?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am,&quot; said he.  &quot;To 
me it is faultless.  Nay, more,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I consider it as the only form of 
building in which happiness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is attainable, and were I rich enough 
I would instantly pull</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Combe down, and build it up again 
in the exact plan of this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cottage.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;With dark narrow stairs and 
a kitchen that smokes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I suppose,&quot; said Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes,&quot;cried he in the same 
eager tone, &quot;with all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and every thing belonging to it;--in 
no one convenience</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or INconvenience about it, should 
the least variation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be perceptible.  Then, and then only, 
under such a roof, I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might perhaps be as happy at Combe 
as I have been at Barton.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I flatter myself,&quot; replied 
Elinor, &quot;that even under</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the disadvantage of better rooms and 
a broader staircase,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you will hereafter find your own house 
as faultless as you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now do this.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There certainly are circumstances,&quot; 
said Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;which might greatly endear it 
to me; but this place will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">always have one claim of my affection, 
which no other can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possibly share.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure 
at Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whose fine eyes were fixed so expressively 
on Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as plainly denoted how well she understood 
him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How often did I wish,&quot; 
added he, &quot;when I was at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Allenham this time twelvemonth, that 
Barton cottage were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inhabited!  I never passed within 
view of it without admiring</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its situation, and grieving that no 
one should live in it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">How little did I then think that the 
very first news</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when 
I next came into</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the country, would be that Barton 
cottage was taken: and I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">felt an immediate satisfaction and 
interest in the event,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which nothing but a kind of prescience 
of what happiness I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should experience from it, can account 
for.  Must it not have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been so, Marianne?&quot; speaking 
to her in a lowered voice.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Then continuing his former tone, he 
said, &quot;And yet this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">house you would spoil, Mrs. Dashwood?  
You would rob it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of its simplicity by imaginary improvement! 
and this dear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">parlour in which our acquaintance 
first began, and in which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so many happy hours have been since 
spent by us together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you would degrade to the condition 
of a common entrance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and every body would be eager to pass 
through the room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which has hitherto contained within 
itself more real</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">accommodation and comfort than any 
other apartment of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the handsomest dimensions in the world 
could possibly afford.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood again assured him that 
no alteration</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the kind should be attempted.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are a good woman,&quot; 
he warmly replied.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your promise makes me easy.  
Extend it a little farther,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it will make me happy.  Tell me 
that not only your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">house will remain the same, but that 
I shall ever find</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you and yours as unchanged as your 
dwelling; and that you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will always consider me with the kindness 
which has made</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">everything belonging to you so dear 
to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The promise was readily given, and 
Willoughby's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaviour during the whole of the 
evening declared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at once his affection and happiness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Shall we see you tomorrow to 
dinner?&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when he was leaving them. &quot;I 
do not ask you to come in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the morning, for we must walk to the 
park, to call on Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He engaged to be with them by four 
o'clock.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 15</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood's visit to Lady Middleton 
took place</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the next day, and two of her daughters 
went with her;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Marianne excused herself from 
being of the party,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">under some trifling pretext of employment; 
and her mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who concluded that a promise had been 
made by Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the night before of calling on her 
while they were absent,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was perfectly satisfied with her remaining 
at home.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On their return from the park they 
found Willoughby's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">curricle and servant in waiting at 
the cottage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Dashwood was convinced that 
her conjecture</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been just.  So far it was all 
as she had foreseen;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but on entering the house she beheld 
what no foresight</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had taught her to expect.  They were 
no sooner in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">passage than Marianne came hastily 
out of the parlour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">apparently in violent affliction, 
with her handkerchief</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at her eyes; and without noticing 
them ran up stairs.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Surprised and alarmed they proceeded 
directly into the room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had just quitted, where they found 
only Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who was leaning against the mantel-piece 
with his back</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">towards them.  He turned round on 
their coming in,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his countenance shewed that he 
strongly partook</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the emotion which over-powered 
Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is anything the matter with 
her?&quot; cried Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she entered--&quot;is she ill?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I hope not,&quot; he replied, 
trying to look cheerful;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and with a forced smile presently 
added, &quot;It is I who may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rather expect to be ill--for I am 
now suffering under a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very heavy disappointment!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Disappointment?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, for I am unable to keep 
my engagement with you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Smith has this morning exercised 
the privilege</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of riches upon a poor dependent cousin, 
by sending me on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">business to London. I have just received 
my dispatches,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and taken my farewell of Allenham; 
and by way of exhilaration</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am now come to take my farewell 
of you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To London!--and are you going 
this morning?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Almost this moment.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;This is very unfortunate.  But 
Mrs. Smith must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be obliged;--and her business will 
not detain you from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">us long I hope.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He coloured as he replied, &quot;You 
are very kind, but I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have no idea of returning into Devonshire 
immediately.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My visits to Mrs. Smith are never 
repeated within</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the twelvemonth.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And is Mrs. Smith your only 
friend?  Is Allenham the only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">house in the neighbourhood to which 
you will be welcome?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">For shame, Willoughby, can you wait 
for an invitation here?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His colour increased; and with his 
eyes fixed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the ground he only replied, &quot;You 
are too good.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood looked at Elinor with 
surprise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor felt equal amazement.  For 
a few moments every one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was silent.  Mrs. Dashwood first spoke.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have only to add, my dear 
Willoughby, that at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Barton cottage you will always be 
welcome; for I will not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">press you to return here immediately, 
because you only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can judge how far THAT might be pleasing 
to Mrs. Smith;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and on this head I shall be no more 
disposed to question</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your judgment than to doubt your inclination.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My engagements at present,&quot; 
replied Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">confusedly, &quot;are of such a nature--that--I 
dare not flatter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He stopt.  Mrs. Dashwood was too much 
astonished</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to speak, and another pause succeeded.  
This was broken</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Willoughby, who said with a faint 
smile, &quot;It is folly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to linger in this manner.  I will 
not torment myself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any longer by remaining among friends 
whose society</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it is impossible for me now to enjoy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He then hastily took leave of them 
all and left</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the room.  They saw him step into 
his carriage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in a minute it was out of sight.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood felt too much for speech, 
and instantly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quitted the parlour to give way in 
solitude to the concern</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and alarm which this sudden departure 
occasioned.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's uneasiness was at least equal 
to her mother's.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She thought of what had just passed 
with anxiety and distrust.  </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby's behaviour in taking leave 
of them, his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">embarrassment, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and affectation of cheerfulness, and, 
above all, his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unwillingness </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to accept her mother's invitation, 
a backwardness so unlike a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lover, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so unlike himself, greatly disturbed 
her.  One moment she feared </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that no serious design had ever been 
formed on his side; and the </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">next that some unfortunate quarrel 
had taken place between him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister;--the distress in which 
Marianne had quitted the room </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was such as a serious quarrel could 
most reasonably account for, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though when she considered what Marianne's 
love for him was, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a quarrel seemed almost impossible.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But whatever might be the particulars 
of their separation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister's affliction was indubitable; 
and she thought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the tenderest compassion of that 
violent sorrow</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which Marianne was in all probability 
not merely giving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">way to as a relief, but feeding and 
encouraging as a duty.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In about half an hour her mother returned, 
and though</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her eyes were red, her countenance 
was not uncheerful.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Our dear Willoughby is now some 
miles from Barton, Elinor,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said she, as she sat down to work, 
&quot;and with how heavy a heart </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">does he travel?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is all very strange.  So 
suddenly to be gone! It</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seems but the work of a moment.  And 
last night he was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with us so happy, so cheerful, so 
affectionate?  And now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after only ten minutes notice--Gone 
too without intending</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to return!--Something more than what 
be owned to us must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have happened.  He did not speak, 
he did not behave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">like himself.  YOU must have seen 
the difference as well as I. </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What can it be?  Can they have quarrelled?  
Why else should he </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have shewn such unwillingness to accept 
your invitation here?&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It was not inclination that 
he wanted, Elinor; I could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">plainly see THAT.  He had not the 
power of accepting it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have thought it all over I assure 
you, and I can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perfectly account for every thing 
that at first seemed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">strange to me as well as to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Can you, indeed!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes. I have explained it to 
myself in the most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">satisfactory way;--but you, Elinor, 
who love to doubt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where you can--it will not satisfy 
YOU, I know; but you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shall not talk ME out of my trust 
in it.  I am persuaded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Mrs. Smith suspects his regard 
for Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disapproves of it, (perhaps because 
she has other views</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for him,) and on that account is eager 
to get him away;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that the business which she sends 
him off to transact</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is invented as an excuse to dismiss 
him.  This is what I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">believe to have happened.  He is, 
moreover, aware that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">DOES disapprove the connection, he 
dares not therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at present confess to her his engagement 
with Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he feels himself obliged, from 
his dependent situation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to give into her schemes, and absent 
himself from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Devonshire for a while.  You will 
tell me, I know,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that this may or may NOT have happened; 
but I will listen</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to no cavil, unless you can point 
out any other method</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of understanding the affair as satisfactory 
at this.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And now, Elinor, what have you to 
say?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Nothing, for you have anticipated 
my answer.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Then you would have told me, 
that it might or might not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have happened.  Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible 
are your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feelings!  You had rather take evil 
upon credit than good.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You had rather look out for misery 
for Marianne, and guilt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for poor Willoughby, than an apology 
for the latter.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You are resolved to think him blameable, 
because he took</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">leave of us with less affection than 
his usual behaviour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has shewn.  And is no allowance to 
be made for inadvertence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or for spirits depressed by recent 
disappointment? Are</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no probabilities to be accepted, merely 
because they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are not certainties?  Is nothing due 
to the man whom we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have all such reason to love, and 
no reason in the world</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to think ill of?  To the possibility 
of motives unanswerable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in themselves, though unavoidably 
secret for a while?  And,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after all, what is it you suspect 
him of?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I can hardly tell myself.  But 
suspicion of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">something unpleasant is the inevitable 
consequence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of such an alteration as we just witnessed 
in him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">There is great truth, however, in 
what you have now urged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the allowances which ought to be 
made for him, and it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is my wish to be candid in my judgment 
of every body.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby may undoubtedly have very 
sufficient</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reasons for his conduct, and I will 
hope that he has.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But it would have been more like Willoughby 
to acknowledge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them at once.  Secrecy may be advisable; 
but still I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cannot help wondering at its being 
practiced by him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do not blame him, however, for 
departing from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his character, where the deviation 
is necessary.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But you really do admit the justice 
of what I have said</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his defence?--I am happy--and he 
is acquitted.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Not entirely.  It may be proper 
to conceal their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">engagement (if they ARE engaged) from 
Mrs. Smith--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if that is the case, it must be 
highly expedient</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Willoughby to be but little in 
Devonshire at present.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But this is no excuse for their concealing 
it from us.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Concealing it from us! my dear 
child, do you accuse </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby and Marianne of concealment? 
This is strange </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indeed, when your eyes have been reproaching 
them every day </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for incautiousness.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I want no proof of their affection,&quot; 
said Elinor;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;but of their engagement I do.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am perfectly satisfied of 
both.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yet not a syllable has been 
said to you on the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subject, by either of them.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have not wanted syllables 
where actions have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spoken so plainly.  Has not his behaviour 
to Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to all of us, for at least the 
last fortnight,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">declared that he loved and considered 
her as his future wife,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that he felt for us the attachment 
of the nearest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">relation?  Have we not perfectly understood 
each other?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Has not my consent been daily asked 
by his looks, his manner,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his attentive and affectionate respect?  
My Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is it possible to doubt their engagement?  
How could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such a thought occur to you?  How 
is it to be supposed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Willoughby, persuaded as he must 
be of your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister's love, should leave her, and 
leave her perhaps</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for months, without telling her of 
his affection;--that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they should part without a mutual 
exchange of confidence?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I confess,&quot; replied Elinor, 
&quot;that every circumstance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">except ONE is in favour of their engagement;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but that ONE is the total silence 
of both on the subject,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and with me it almost outweighs every 
other.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How strange this is!  You must 
think wretchedly indeed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Willoughby, if, after all that 
has openly passed between them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you can doubt the nature of the terms 
on which they are together.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Has he been acting a part in his behaviour 
to your sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all this time?  Do you suppose him 
really indifferent to her?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, I cannot think that.  He 
must and does love her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But with a strange kind of tenderness, 
if he can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">leave her with such indifference, 
such carelessness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the future, as you attribute to 
him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You must remember, my dear mother, 
that I have never</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">considered this matter as certain. I 
have had my doubts,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I confess; but they are fainter than 
they were, and they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may soon be entirely done away.  If 
we find they correspond,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every fear of mine will be removed.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;A mighty concession indeed!  
If you were to see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them at the altar, you would suppose 
they were going to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be married.  Ungracious girl!  But 
I require no such proof.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nothing in my opinion has ever passed 
to justify doubt;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no secrecy has been attempted; all 
has been uniformly open</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and unreserved.  You cannot doubt 
your sister's wishes.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It must be Willoughby therefore whom 
you suspect.  But why? </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Is he not a man of honour and feeling? 
Has there been any </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inconsistency on his side to create 
alarm? can he be deceitful?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I hope not, I believe not,&quot;cried 
Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I love Willoughby, sincerely 
love him; and suspicion of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">integrity cannot be more painful to 
yourself than to me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It has been involuntary, and I will 
not encourage it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I was startled, I confess, by the 
alteration in his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">manners this morning;--he did not 
speak like himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and did not return your kindness with 
any cordiality.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But all this may be explained by such 
a situation of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affairs as you have supposed.  He 
had just parted from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my sister, had seen her leave him 
in the greatest affliction;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if he felt obliged, from a fear 
of offending Mrs. Smith,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to resist the temptation of returning 
here soon, and yet</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">aware that by declining your invitation, 
by saying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he was going away for some time, 
he should seem</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to act an ungenerous, a suspicious 
part by our family,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be might well be embarrassed and disturbed.  
In such a case,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a plain and open avowal of his difficulties 
would have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more to his honour I think, as well 
as more consistent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with his general character;--but I 
will not raise objections</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against any one's conduct on so illiberal 
a foundation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as a difference in judgment from myself, 
or a deviation from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what I may think right and consistent.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You speak very properly.  Willoughby 
certainly does</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not deserve to be suspected.  Though 
WE have not known</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him long, he is no stranger in this 
part of the world;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and who has ever spoken to his disadvantage?  
Had he been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a situation to act independently 
and marry immediately,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it might have been odd that he should 
leave us without</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acknowledging everything to me at 
once: but this is not the case.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is an engagement in some respects 
not prosperously begun,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for their marriage must be at a very 
uncertain distance;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and even secrecy, as far as it can 
be observed, may now</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be very advisable.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were interrupted by the entrance 
of Margaret;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor was then at liberty to 
think over the representations</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her mother, to acknowledge the 
probability of many,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and hope for the justice of all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They saw nothing of Marianne till 
dinner time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when she entered the room and took 
her place at the table</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without saying a word. Her eyes were 
red and swollen;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it seemed as if her tears were 
even then restrained</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with difficulty. She avoided the looks 
of them all,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could neither eat nor speak, and after 
some time, on her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother's silently pressing her hand 
with tender compassion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her small degree of fortitude was 
quite overcome, she burst</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into tears and left the room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This violent oppression of spirits 
continued the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whole evening. She was without any 
power, because she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was without any desire of command 
over herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The slightest mention of anything 
relative to Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">overpowered her in an instant; and 
though her family</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were most anxiously attentive to her 
comfort, it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">impossible for them, if they spoke 
at all, to keep clear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of every subject which her feelings 
connected with him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 16</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne would have thought herself 
very inexcusable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had she been able to sleep at all 
the first night</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after parting from Willoughby.  She 
would have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ashamed to look her family in the 
face the next morning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had she not risen from her bed in 
more need of repose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than when she lay down in it.  But 
the feelings which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made such composure a disgrace, left 
her in no danger</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of incurring it.  She was awake the 
whole night, and she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wept the greatest part of it.  She 
got up with a headache,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was unable to talk, and unwilling 
to take any nourishment;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">giving pain every moment to her mother 
and sisters,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and forbidding all attempt at consolation 
from either.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her sensibility was potent enough!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When breakfast was over she walked 
out by herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and wandered about the village of 
Allenham, indulging the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">recollection of past enjoyment and 
crying over the present</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reverse for the chief of the morning.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The evening passed off in the equal 
indulgence of feeling.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She played over every favourite song 
that she had been used</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to play to Willoughby, every air in 
which their voices</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been oftenest joined, and sat 
at the instrument gazing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on every line of music that he had 
written out for her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">till her heart was so heavy that no 
farther sadness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could be gained; and this nourishment 
of grief was every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">day applied.  She spent whole hours 
at the pianoforte</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">alternately singing and crying; her 
voice often totally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suspended by her tears.  In books 
too, as well as in music,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she courted the misery which a contrast 
between the past</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and present was certain of giving.  
She read nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but what they had been used to read 
together.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Such violence of affliction indeed 
could not be supported</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for ever; it sunk within a few days 
into a calmer melancholy;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but these employments, to which she 
daily recurred,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her solitary walks and silent meditations, 
still produced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">occasional effusions of sorrow as 
lively as ever.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No letter from Willoughby came; and 
none seemed expected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Marianne.  Her mother was surprised, 
and Elinor again</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">became uneasy.  But Mrs. Dashwood 
could find explanations</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whenever she wanted them, which at 
least satisfied herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Remember, Elinor,&quot; said 
she, &quot;how very often Sir John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fetches our letters himself from the 
post, and carries them </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to it.  We have already agreed that 
secrecy may be necessary,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and we must acknowledge that it could 
not be maintained if </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their correspondence were to pass 
through Sir John's hands.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not deny the truth of 
this, and she tried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to find in it a motive sufficient 
for their silence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But there was one method so direct, 
so simple, and in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her opinion so eligible of knowing 
the real state</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the affair, and of instantly removing 
all mystery,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she could not help suggesting 
it to her mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why do you not ask Marianne 
at once,&quot; said she,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;whether she is or she is not 
engaged to Willoughby?  From you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her mother, and so kind, so indulgent 
a mother, the question</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not give offence.  It would 
be the natural result</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of your affection for her. She used 
to be all unreserve,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to you more especially.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I would not ask such a question 
for the world.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Supposing it possible that they are 
not engaged,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what distress would not such an enquiry 
inflict!  At any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rate it would be most ungenerous. I 
should never deserve</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her confidence again, after forcing 
from her a confession</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what is meant at present to be 
unacknowledged to any one.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I know Marianne's heart: I know that 
she dearly loves me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that I shall not be the last to 
whom the affair is made</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">known,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when circumstances make the revealment 
of it eligible.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I would not attempt to force the confidence 
of any one;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a child much less; because a sense 
of duty would prevent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the denial which her wishes might 
direct.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor thought this generosity overstrained,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">considering her sister's youth, and 
urged the matter farther,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but in vain; common sense, common 
care, common prudence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood's romantic 
delicacy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was several days before Willoughby's 
name</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was mentioned before Marianne by any 
of her family;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, 
were not so nice;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their witticisms added pain to many 
a painful hour;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally 
taking up a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">volume of Shakespeare, exclaimed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We have never finished Hamlet, 
Marianne; our dear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby went away before we could 
get through it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">We will put it by, that when he comes 
again...But it may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be months, perhaps, before THAT happens.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Months!&quot; cried Marianne, 
with strong surprise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No--nor many weeks.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she 
had said;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it gave Elinor pleasure, as it 
produced a reply</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from Marianne so expressive of confidence 
in Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and knowledge of his intentions.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One morning, about a week after his 
leaving the country,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was prevailed on to join 
her sisters in their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">usual walk, instead of wandering away 
by herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Hitherto she had carefully avoided 
every companion in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her rambles.  If her sisters intended 
to walk on the downs,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she directly stole away towards the 
lanes; if they talked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the valley, she was as speedy in 
climbing the hills,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and could never be found when the 
others set off.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But at length she was secured by the 
exertions of Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who greatly disapproved such continual 
seclusion.  They walked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">along the road through the valley, 
and chiefly in silence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Marianne's MIND could not be controlled, 
and Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">satisfied with gaining one point, 
would not then attempt more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Beyond the entrance of the valley, 
where the country,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though still rich, was less wild and 
more open, a long</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stretch of the road which they had 
travelled on first coming</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Barton, lay before them; and on 
reaching that point,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they stopped to look around them, 
and examine a prospect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which formed the distance of their 
view from the cottage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from a spot which they had never happened 
to reach in any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their walks before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Amongst the objects in the scene, 
they soon discovered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an animated one; it was a man on horseback 
riding towards them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In a few minutes they could distinguish 
him to be a gentleman;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in a moment afterwards Marianne 
rapturously exclaimed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is he; it is indeed;--I know 
it is!&quot;--and was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hastening to meet him, when Elinor 
cried out,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed, Marianne, I think you 
are mistaken.  It is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not Willoughby.  The person is not 
tall enough for him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and has not his air.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He has, he has,&quot; cried 
Marianne, &quot;I am sure he has.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His air, his coat, his horse.  I knew 
how soon he would come.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She walked eagerly on as she spoke; 
and Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to screen Marianne from particularity, 
as she felt almost</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">certain of its not being Willoughby, 
quickened her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pace and kept up with her.  They were 
soon within</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thirty yards of the gentleman.  Marianne 
looked again;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her heart sunk within her; and abruptly 
turning round,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was hurrying back, when the voices 
of both her sisters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were raised to detain her; a third, 
almost as well known</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as Willoughby's, joined them in begging 
her to stop,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she turned round with surprise 
to see and welcome</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward Ferrars.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was the only person in the world 
who could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at that moment be forgiven for not 
being Willoughby;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the only one who could have gained 
a smile from her;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but she dispersed her tears to smile 
on HIM, and in her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister's happiness forgot for a time 
her own disappointment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He dismounted, and giving his horse 
to his servant,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">walked back with them to Barton, whither 
he was purposely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">coming to visit them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was welcomed by them all with great 
cordiality,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but especially by Marianne, who showed 
more warmth of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">regard in her reception of him than 
even Elinor herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between 
Edward and her sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was but a continuation of that unaccountable 
coldness which she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had often observed at Norland in their 
mutual behaviour.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On Edward's side, more particularly, 
there was a deficiency</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all that a lover ought to look 
and say on such an occasion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was confused, seemed scarcely sensible 
of pleasure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in seeing them, looked neither rapturous 
nor gay,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said little but what was forced from 
him by questions,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and distinguished Elinor by no mark 
of affection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne saw and listened with increasing 
surprise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She began almost to feel a dislike 
of Edward; and it ended,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as every feeling must end with her, 
by carrying back her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners 
formed a contrast</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sufficiently striking to those of 
his brother elect.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After a short silence which succeeded 
the first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">surprise and enquiries of meeting, 
Marianne asked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward if he came directly from London.  
No, he had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been in Devonshire a fortnight.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;A fortnight!&quot; she repeated, 
surprised at his being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so long in the same county with Elinor 
without seeing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He looked rather distressed as he 
added, that he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been staying with some friends 
near Plymouth.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Have you been lately in Sussex?&quot; 
said Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I was at Norland about a month 
ago.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And how does dear, dear Norland 
look?&quot; cried Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Dear, dear Norland,&quot; said 
Elinor, &quot;probably looks</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much as it always does at this time 
of the year.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The woods and walks thickly covered 
with dead leaves.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh,&quot; cried Marianne, &quot;with 
what transporting sensation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have I formerly seen them fall!  How 
have I delighted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as I walked, to see them driven in 
showers about me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the wind!  What feelings have they, 
the season, the air</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">altogether inspired!  Now there is 
no one to regard them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They are seen only as a nuisance, 
swept hastily off,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and driven as much as possible from 
the sight.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is not every one,&quot; said 
Elinor, &quot;who has your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">passion for dead leaves.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No; my feelings are not often 
shared, not often</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">understood.  But SOMETIMES they are.&quot;--As 
she said this,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she sunk into a reverie for a few 
moments;--but rousing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself again, &quot;Now, Edward,&quot; 
said she, calling his attention</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the prospect, &quot;here is Barton 
valley.  Look up to it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and be tranquil if you can.  Look 
at those hills!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Did you ever see their equals?  To 
the left is Barton park,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">amongst those woods and plantations.  
You may see the end</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the house.  And there, beneath 
that farthest hill,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which rises with such grandeur, is 
our cottage.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is a beautiful country,&quot; 
he replied; &quot;but these</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bottoms must be dirty in winter.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How can you think of dirt, with 
such objects before you?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Because,&quot; replied he, smiling,&quot;among 
the rest of the </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">objects before me, I see a very dirty 
lane.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How strange!&quot; said Marianne 
to herself as she walked on.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Have you an agreeable neighbourhood 
here?  Are the </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middletons pleasant people?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, not all,&quot; answered 
Marianne; &quot;we could not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be more unfortunately situated.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Marianne,&quot;cried her sister, 
&quot;how can you say so? How can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you be so unjust?  They are a very 
respectable family, Mr.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Ferrars;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and towards us have behaved in the 
friendliest manner.  Have you </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">forgot, Marianne, how many pleasant 
days we have owed to them?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No,&quot;said Marianne, in a 
low voice, &quot;nor how many</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">painful moments.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor took no notice of this; and 
directing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her attention to their visitor, endeavoured 
to support</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">something like discourse with him, 
by talking of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">present residence, its conveniences, 
&amp;c. extorting from him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">occasional questions and remarks.  
His coldness and reserve</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mortified her severely; she was vexed 
and half angry;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but resolving to regulate her behaviour 
to him by the past</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rather than the present, she avoided 
every appearance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of resentment or displeasure, and 
treated him as she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thought he ought to be treated from 
the family connection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 17</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for 
a moment at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seeing him; for his coming to Barton 
was, in her opinion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all things the most natural.  Her 
joy and expression</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of regard long outlived her wonder.  
He received the kindest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">welcome from her; and shyness, coldness, 
reserve could not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stand against such a reception. They 
had begun to fail him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before he entered the house, and they 
were quite overcome</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the captivating manners of Mrs. 
Dashwood.  Indeed a man</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not very well be in love with 
either of her daughters,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without extending the passion to her; 
and Elinor had the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">satisfaction of seeing him soon become 
more like himself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His affections seemed to reanimate 
towards them all,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his interest in their welfare 
again became perceptible.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was not in spirits, however; he 
praised their house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">admired its prospect, was attentive, 
and kind; but still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he was not in spirits. The whole family 
perceived it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it 
to some want of liberality</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his mother, sat down to table indignant 
against all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">selfish parents.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What are Mrs. Ferrars's views 
for you at present, Edward?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said she, when dinner was over and 
they had drawn round</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the fire; &quot;are you still to be 
a great orator in spite of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yourself?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No. I hope my mother is now 
convinced that I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no more talents than inclination for 
a public life!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But how is your fame to be established? 
for famous you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be to satisfy all your family; 
and with no inclination</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for expense, no affection for strangers, 
no profession,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and no assurance, you may find it 
a difficult matter.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I shall not attempt it.  I have 
no wish to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">distinguished; and have every reason 
to hope I never shall.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced into 
genius and eloquence.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You have no ambition, I well 
know.  Your wishes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are all moderate.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;As moderate as those of the 
rest of the world,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I believe.  I wish as well as every 
body else to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perfectly happy; but, like every body 
else it must be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in my own way.  Greatness will not 
make me so.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Strange that it would!&quot; 
cried Marianne.  &quot;What have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wealth or grandeur to do with happiness?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Grandeur has but little,&quot; 
said Elinor, &quot;but wealth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has much to do with it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Elinor, for shame!&quot; said 
Marianne, &quot;money can only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">give happiness where there is nothing 
else to give it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Beyond a competence, it can afford 
no real satisfaction,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as far as mere self is concerned.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Elinor, 
smiling, &quot;we may come</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the same point.  YOUR competence 
and MY wealth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are very much alike, I dare say; and 
without them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the world goes now, we shall both 
agree that every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">kind of external comfort must be wanting.  
Your ideas</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are only more noble than mine. Come, 
what is your competence?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;About eighteen hundred or two 
thousand a year;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not more than THAT.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor laughed.  &quot;TWO thousand 
a year! ONE is my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wealth! I guessed how it would end.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And yet two thousand a-year 
is a very moderate income,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Marianne.  &quot;A family cannot 
well be maintained on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a smaller.  I am sure I am not extravagant 
in my demands.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A proper establishment of servants, 
a carriage, perhaps two,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and hunters, cannot be supported on 
less.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister 
describing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so accurately their future expenses 
at Combe Magna.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Hunters!&quot; repeated Edward--&quot;but 
why must you have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hunters?  Every body does not hunt.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne coloured as she replied, 
&quot;But most people do.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I wish,&quot;said Margaret, 
striking out a novel thought,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;that somebody would give us 
all a large fortune apiece!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh that they would!&quot; cried 
Marianne, her eyes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sparkling with animation, and her 
cheeks glowing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the delight of such imaginary 
happiness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We are all unanimous in that 
wish, I suppose,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Elinor, &quot;in spite of the 
insufficiency of wealth.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh dear!&quot;cried Margaret, 
&quot;how happy I should be!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I wonder what I should do with it!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne looked as if she had no doubt 
on that point.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I should be puzzled to spend 
so large a fortune myself,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Mrs. Dashwood, &quot;if my children 
were all to be rich</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my help.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You must begin your improvements 
on this house,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">observed Elinor, &quot;and your difficulties 
will soon vanish.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What magnificent orders would 
travel from this family</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to London,&quot; said Edward, &quot;in 
such an event!  What a happy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">day for booksellers, music-sellers, 
and print-shops! You,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood, would give a general 
commission for every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">new print of merit to be sent you--and 
as for Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I know her greatness of soul, there 
would not be music enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in London to content her.  And books!--Thomson, 
Cowper,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Scott--she would buy them all over 
and over again: she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would buy up every copy, I believe, 
to prevent their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">falling into unworthy hands; and she 
would have every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">book that tells her how to admire 
an old twisted tree.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Should not you, Marianne?  Forgive 
me, if I am very saucy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I was willing to shew you that 
I had not forgot our</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">old disputes.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I love to be reminded of the 
past, Edward--whether it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be melancholy or gay, I love to recall 
it--and you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will never offend me by talking of 
former times.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You are very right in supposing how 
my money would be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spent--some of it, at least--my loose 
cash would certainly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be employed in improving my collection 
of music and books.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And the bulk of your fortune 
would be laid out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in annuities on the authors or their 
heirs.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, Edward, I should have something 
else to do</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps, then, you would bestow 
it as a reward on that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">person who wrote the ablest defence 
of your favourite maxim,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that no one can ever be in love more 
than once in their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">life--your opinion on that point is 
unchanged, I presume?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Undoubtedly. At my time of life 
opinions are tolerably fixed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is not likely that I should now 
see or hear any thing to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">change them.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Marianne is as steadfast as 
ever, you see,&quot; said Elinor, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;she is not at all altered.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She is only grown a little more 
grave than she was.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Nay, Edward,&quot; said Marianne, 
&quot;you need not reproach me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You are not very gay yourself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why should you think so!&quot;replied 
he, with a sigh.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But gaiety never was a part 
of MY character.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Nor do I think it a part of 
Marianne's,&quot;said Elinor;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I should hardly call her a lively 
girl--she is very earnest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very eager in all she does--sometimes 
talks a great deal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and always with animation--but she 
is not often really merry.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I believe you are right,&quot; 
he replied, &quot;and yet I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have always set her down as a lively 
girl.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have frequently detected myself 
in such kind of mistakes,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Elinor, &quot;in a total misapprehension 
of character in some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">point or other: fancying people so 
much more gay or grave,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or ingenious or stupid than they really 
are, and I can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hardly tell why or in what the deception 
originated.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sometimes one is guided by what they 
say of themselves,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and very frequently by what other 
people say of them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without giving oneself time to deliberate 
and judge.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But I thought it was right, 
Elinor,&quot; said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;to be guided wholly by the opinion 
of other people.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I thought our judgments were given 
us merely to be subservient</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to those of neighbours.  This has 
always been your doctrine,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, Marianne, never.  My doctrine 
has never aimed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the subjection of the understanding.  
All I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ever attempted to influence has been 
the behaviour.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You must not confound my meaning.  
I am guilty, I confess,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of having often wished you to treat 
our acquaintance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in general with greater attention; 
but when have I advised</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you to adopt their sentiments or to 
conform to their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">judgment in serious matters?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You have not been able to bring 
your sister over to your </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">plan of general civility,&quot; said 
Edward to Elinor, &quot;Do you gain </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no ground?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Quite the contrary,&quot; replied 
Elinor, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">looking expressively at Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My judgment,&quot; he returned,&quot;is 
all on your side</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the question; but I am afraid my 
practice is much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more on your sister's.  I never wish 
to offend, but I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">am so foolishly shy, that I often 
seem negligent,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when I am only kept back by my natural 
awkwardness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have frequently thought that I must 
have been intended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by nature to be fond of low company, 
I am so little at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my ease among strangers of gentility!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Marianne has not shyness to 
excuse any inattention</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of hers,&quot; said Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She knows her own worth too 
well for false shame,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">replied Edward.  &quot;Shyness is 
only the effect of a sense</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of inferiority in some way or other.  
If I could persuade</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself that my manners were perfectly 
easy and graceful,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I should not be shy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But you would still be reserved,&quot; 
said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;and that is worse.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward started--&quot;Reserved! Am 
I reserved, Marianne?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, very.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not understand you,&quot; 
replied he, colouring.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Reserved!--how, in what manner?  
What am I to tell you?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What can you suppose?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; 
but trying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to laugh off the subject, she said 
to him, &quot;Do not you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know my sister well enough to understand 
what she means?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Do not you know she calls every one 
reserved who does not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">talk as fast, and admire what she 
admires as rapturously</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as herself?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward made no answer.  His gravity 
and thoughtfulness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">returned on him in their fullest extent--and 
he sat</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for some time silent and dull.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 18</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor saw, with great uneasiness 
the low spirits</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her friend.  His visit afforded 
her but a very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">partial satisfaction, while his own 
enjoyment in it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">appeared so imperfect.  It was evident 
that he was unhappy;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she wished it were equally evident 
that he still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">distinguished her by the same affection 
which once</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had felt no doubt of inspiring; 
but hitherto the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">continuance of his preference seemed 
very uncertain;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the reservedness of his manner 
towards her contradicted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one moment what a more animated look 
had intimated the preceding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He joined her and Marianne in the 
breakfast-room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the next morning before the others 
were down; and Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who was always eager to promote their 
happiness as far</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she could, soon left them to themselves.  
But before she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was half way upstairs she heard the 
parlour door open, and,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">turning round, was astonished to see 
Edward himself come out.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am going into the village 
to see my horses,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said be, &quot;as you are not yet 
ready for breakfast; I shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be back again presently.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                    ***</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward returned to them with fresh 
admiration</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the surrounding country; in his 
walk to the village,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he had seen many parts of the valley 
to advantage;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the village itself, in a much 
higher situation than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the cottage, afforded a general view 
of the whole, which had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exceedingly pleased him.  This was 
a subject which ensured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's attention, and she was 
beginning to describe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her own admiration of these scenes, 
and to question him more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">minutely on the objects that had particularly 
struck him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when Edward interrupted her by saying, 
&quot;You must not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enquire too far, Marianne--remember 
I have no knowledge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the picturesque, and I shall offend 
you by my ignorance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and want of taste if we come to particulars.  
I shall call</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hills steep, which ought to be bold; 
surfaces strange</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and uncouth, which ought to be irregular 
and rugged;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and distant objects out of sight, 
which ought only to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indistinct through the soft medium 
of a hazy atmosphere.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You must be satisfied with such admiration 
as I can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">honestly give.  I call it a very fine 
country--the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hills are steep, the woods seem full 
of fine timber,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the valley looks comfortable and 
snug--with rich</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">meadows and several neat farm houses 
scattered here</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and there. It exactly answers my idea 
of a fine country,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because it unites beauty with utility--and 
I dare say it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is a picturesque one too, because 
you admire it; I can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">easily believe it to be full of rocks 
and promontories,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">grey moss and brush wood, but these 
are all lost on me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I know nothing of the picturesque.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am afraid it is but too true,&quot; 
said Marianne;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;but why should you boast of 
it?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I suspect,&quot; said Elinor, 
&quot;that to avoid one kind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of affectation, Edward here falls 
into another.  Because he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">believes many people pretend to more 
admiration of the beauties</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of nature than they really feel, and 
is disgusted with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such pretensions, he affects greater 
indifference and less</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">discrimination in viewing them himself 
than he possesses.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He is fastidious and will have an 
affectation of his own.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is very true,&quot; said 
Marianne, &quot;that admiration</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of landscape scenery is become a mere 
jargon.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Every body pretends to feel and tries 
to describe with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the taste and elegance of him who 
first defined what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">picturesque beauty was.  I detest 
jargon of every kind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sometimes I have kept my feelings 
to myself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because I could find no language to 
describe them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in but what was worn and hackneyed 
out of all sense and meaning.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am convinced,&quot; said Edward, 
&quot;that you really feel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all the delight in a fine prospect 
which you profess</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to feel.  But, in return, your sister 
must allow me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to feel no more than I profess.  I 
like a fine prospect,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but not on picturesque principles.  
I do not like crooked,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">twisted, blasted trees.  I admire 
them much more if they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are tall, straight, and flourishing.  
I do not like ruined,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tattered cottages.  I am not fond 
of nettles or thistles,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or heath blossoms.  I have more pleasure 
in a snug</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">farm-house than a watch-tower--and 
a troop of tidy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happy villages please me better than 
the finest banditti</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne looked with amazement at 
Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with compassion at her sister.  Elinor 
only laughed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The subject was continued no farther; 
and Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">remained thoughtfully silent, till 
a new object suddenly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">engaged her attention.  She was sitting 
by Edward, and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, 
his hand passed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so directly before her, as to make 
a ring, with a plait</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of hair in the centre, very conspicuous 
on one of his fingers.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I never saw you wear a ring 
before, Edward,&quot; she cried.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is that Fanny's hair? I remember 
her promising to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you some. But I should have thought 
her hair had been darker.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne spoke inconsiderately what 
she really felt--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but when she saw how much she had 
pained Edward, her own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">vexation at her want of thought could 
not be surpassed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by his.  He coloured very deeply, 
and giving a momentary</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">glance at Elinor, replied, &quot;Yes; 
it is my sister's hair.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The setting always casts a different 
shade on it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor had met his eye, and looked 
conscious likewise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">That the hair was her own, she instantaneously 
felt as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well satisfied as Marianne; the only 
difference in their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conclusions was, that what Marianne 
considered as a free</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious 
must have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">procured by some theft or contrivance 
unknown to herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was not in a humour, however, 
to regard it as an affront,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and affecting to take no notice of 
what passed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by instantly talking of something 
else, she internally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">resolved henceforward to catch every 
opportunity of eyeing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the hair and of satisfying herself, 
beyond all doubt,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that it was exactly the shade of her 
own.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward's embarrassment lasted some 
time, and it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ended in an absence of mind still 
more settled.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was particularly grave the whole 
morning.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne severely censured herself 
for what she had said;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but her own forgiveness might have 
been more speedy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had she known how little offence it 
had given her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Before the middle of the day, they 
were visited by Sir</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having 
heard of the arrival</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a gentleman at the cottage, came 
to take a survey</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the guest.  With the assistance 
of his mother-in-law,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John was not long in discovering 
that the name of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Ferrars began with an F. and this 
prepared a future mine</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of raillery against the devoted Elinor, 
which nothing but</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the newness of their acquaintance 
with Edward could have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">prevented from being immediately sprung.  
But, as it was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she only learned, from some very significant 
looks, how far</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their penetration, founded on Margaret's 
instructions, extended.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John never came to the Dashwoods 
without either</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inviting them to dine at the park 
the next day, or to drink</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tea with them that evening. On the 
present occasion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the better entertainment of their 
visitor, towards</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whose amusement he felt himself bound 
to contribute,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he wished to engage them for both.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You MUST drink tea with us to 
night,&quot; said he,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;for we shall be quite alone--and 
tomorrow you must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">absolutely dine with us, for we shall 
be a large party.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity.  
&quot;And who knows</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but you may raise a dance,&quot; said 
she.  &quot;And that will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tempt YOU, Miss Marianne.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;A dance!&quot; cried Marianne.  
&quot;Impossible! Who is to dance?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Who! why yourselves, and the 
Careys, and Whitakers</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be sure.--What! you thought nobody 
could dance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because a certain person that shall 
be nameless is gone!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I wish with all my soul,&quot; 
cried Sir John,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;that Willoughby were among us 
again.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This, and Marianne's blushing, gave 
new suspicions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Edward.  &quot;And who is Willoughby?&quot; 
said he, in a low voice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Miss Dashwood, by whom he was sitting.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She gave him a brief reply.  Marianne's 
countenance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was more communicative.  Edward saw 
enough to comprehend,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not only the meaning of others, but 
such of Marianne's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expressions as had puzzled him before; 
and when their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">visitors left them, he went immediately 
round her, and said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a whisper, &quot;I have been guessing.  
Shall I tell you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my guess?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Shall I tell you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well then; I guess that Mr. 
Willoughby hunts.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was surprised and confused, 
yet she could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not help smiling at the quiet archness 
of his manner,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and after a moment's silence, said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, Edward! How can you?--But 
the time will come</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I hope...I am sure you will like him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not doubt it,&quot; replied 
he, rather astonished</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at her earnestness and warmth; for 
had he not imagined it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be a joke for the good of her acquaintance 
in general,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">founded only on a something or a nothing 
between Mr. Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and herself, he would not have ventured 
to mention it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 19</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward remained a week at the cottage; 
he was earnestly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pressed by Mrs. Dashwood to stay longer; 
but, as if he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were bent only on self-mortification, 
he seemed resolved</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be gone when his enjoyment among 
his friends was at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the height.  His spirits, during the 
last two or three days,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though still very unequal, were greatly 
improved--he grew</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more and more partial to the house 
and environs--never</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spoke of going away without a sigh--declared 
his time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be wholly disengaged--even doubted 
to what place he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should go when he left them--but still, 
go he must.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Never had any week passed so quickly--he 
could hardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">believe it to be gone.  He said so 
repeatedly; other things</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he said too, which marked the turn 
of his feelings and gave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the lie to his actions.  He had no 
pleasure at Norland;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he detested being in town; but either 
to Norland or London,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he must go.  He valued their kindness 
beyond any thing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his greatest happiness was in 
being with them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Yet, he must leave them at the end 
of a week, in spite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their wishes and his own, and without 
any restraint </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on his time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor placed all that was astonishing 
in this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">way of acting to his mother's account; 
and it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happy for her that he had a mother 
whose character</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was so imperfectly known to her, as 
to be the general</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">excuse for every thing strange on 
the part of her son.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Disappointed, however, and vexed as 
she was, and sometimes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">displeased with his uncertain behaviour 
to herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was very well disposed on the 
whole to regard his actions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with all the candid allowances and 
generous qualifications,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which had been rather more painfully 
extorted from her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Willoughby's service, by her mother.  
His want of spirits,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of openness, and of consistency, were 
most usually</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attributed to his want of independence, 
and his better</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">knowledge of Mrs. Ferrars's disposition 
and designs.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The shortness of his visit, the steadiness 
of his purpose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in leaving them, originated in the 
same fettered inclination,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the same inevitable necessity of temporizing 
with his mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The old well-established grievance 
of duty against will,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">parent against child, was the cause 
of all. She would have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been glad to know when these difficulties 
were to cease,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this opposition was to yield,--when 
Mrs. Ferrars would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be reformed, and her son be at liberty 
to be happy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But from such vain wishes she was 
forced to turn for comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the renewal of her confidence in 
Edward's affection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the remembrance of every mark of 
regard in look or word</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which fell from him while at Barton, 
and above all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to that flattering proof of it which 
he constantly wore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">round his finger.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I think, Edward,&quot; said 
Mrs. Dashwood, as they were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at breakfast the last morning, &quot;you 
would be a happier man</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if you had any profession to engage 
your time and give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an interest to your plans and actions.  
Some inconvenience</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to your friends, indeed, might result 
from it--you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would not be able to give them so 
much of your time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But (with a smile) you would be materially 
benefited</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in one particular at least--you would 
know where to go</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when you left them.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do assure you,&quot; he replied, 
&quot;that I have long</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thought on this point, as you think 
now.  It has been,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and is, and probably will always be 
a heavy misfortune</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to me, that I have had no necessary 
business to engage me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no profession to give me employment, 
or afford me any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thing like independence.  But unfortunately 
my own nicety,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the nicety of my friends, have 
made me what I am,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an idle, helpless being.  We never 
could agree in our</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">choice of a profession. I always preferred 
the church,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as I still do.  But that was not smart 
enough for my family.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They recommended the army. That was 
a great deal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too smart for me.  The law was allowed 
to be genteel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enough; many young men, who had chambers 
in the Temple,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made a very good appearance in the 
first circles,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and drove about town in very knowing 
gigs.  But I had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no inclination for the law, even in 
this less abstruse</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">study of it, which my family approved.  
As for the navy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it had fashion on its side, but I 
was too old when the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subject was first started to enter 
it--and, at length,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as there was no necessity for my having 
any profession</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at all, as I might be as dashing and 
expensive without</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a red coat on my back as with one, 
idleness was pronounced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the whole to be most advantageous 
and honourable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a young man of eighteen is not 
in general so earnestly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bent on being busy as to resist the 
solicitations of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">friends to do nothing.  I was therefore 
entered at Oxford</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and have been properly idle ever since.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The consequence of which, I 
suppose, will be,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Mrs. Dashwood, &quot;since leisure 
has not promoted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your own happiness, that your sons 
will be brought up</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to as many pursuits, employments, 
professions, and trades</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as Columella's.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;They will be brought up,&quot; 
said he, in a serious accent,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;to be as unlike myself as is 
possible.  In feeling,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in action, in condition, in every 
thing.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Come, come; this is all an effusion 
of immediate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">want of spirits, Edward.  You are 
in a melancholy humour,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and fancy that any one unlike yourself 
must be happy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But remember that the pain of parting 
from friends</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will be felt by every body at times, 
whatever be their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">education or state.  Know your own 
happiness.  You want</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing but patience--or give it a 
more fascinating name,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">call it hope.  Your mother will secure 
to you, in time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that independence you are so anxious 
for; it is her duty,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it will, it must ere long become 
her happiness to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">prevent your whole youth from being 
wasted in discontent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">How much may not a few months do?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I think,&quot; replied Edward, 
&quot;that I may defy many</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">months to produce any good to me.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This desponding turn of mind, though 
it could not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be communicated to Mrs. Dashwood, 
gave additional pain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to them all in the parting, which 
shortly took place,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and left an uncomfortable impression 
on Elinor's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feelings especially, which required 
some trouble and time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to subdue.  But as it was her determination 
to subdue it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to prevent herself from appearing 
to suffer more than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what all her family suffered on his 
going away, she did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not adopt the method so judiciously 
employed by Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on a similar occasion, to augment 
and fix her sorrow,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by seeking silence, solitude and idleness.  
Their means</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were as different as their objects, 
and equally suited</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the advancement of each.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor sat down to her drawing-table 
as soon as he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was out of the house, busily employed 
herself the whole day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">neither sought nor avoided the mention 
of his name,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">appeared to interest herself almost 
as much as ever in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">general concerns of the family, and 
if, by this conduct,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she did not lessen her own grief, 
it was at least prevented</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from unnecessary increase, and her 
mother and sisters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were spared much solicitude on her 
account.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Such behaviour as this, so exactly 
the reverse</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her own, appeared no more meritorious 
to Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than her own had seemed faulty to 
her.  The business</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of self-command she settled very easily;--with 
strong</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affections it was impossible, with 
calm ones it could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have no merit.  That her sister's 
affections WERE calm,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she dared not deny, though she blushed 
to acknowledge it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and of the strength of her own, she 
gave a very striking proof,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by still loving and respecting that 
sister, in spite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of this mortifying conviction.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Without shutting herself up from her 
family,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or leaving the house in determined 
solitude to avoid them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or lying awake the whole night to 
indulge meditation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor found every day afforded her 
leisure enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to think of Edward, and of Edward's 
behaviour, in every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possible variety which the different 
state of her spirits</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at different times could produce,--with 
tenderness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pity, approbation, censure, and doubt.  
There were moments</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in abundance, when, if not by the 
absence of her mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sisters, at least by the nature 
of their employments,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conversation was forbidden among them, 
and every effect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of solitude was produced.  Her mind 
was inevitably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at liberty; her thoughts could not 
be chained elsewhere;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the past and the future, on a 
subject so interesting,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be before her, must force her 
attention, and engross</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her memory, her reflection, and her 
fancy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">From a reverie of this kind, as she 
sat at her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">drawing-table, she was roused one 
morning, soon after</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward's leaving them, by the arrival 
of company.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She happened to be quite alone. The 
closing of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">little gate, at the entrance of the 
green court in front</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the house, drew her eyes to the 
window, and she saw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a large party walking up to the door. Amongst 
them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were Sir John and Lady Middleton and 
Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but there were two others, a gentleman 
and lady, who were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite unknown to her.  She was sitting 
near the window,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as soon as Sir John perceived 
her, he left the rest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the party to the ceremony of knocking 
at the door,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and stepping across the turf, obliged 
her to open the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">casement to speak to him, though the 
space was so short</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">between the door and the window, as 
to make it hardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possible to speak at one without being 
heard at the other.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well,&quot;said he, &quot;we 
have brought you some strangers.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">How do you like them?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Hush! they will hear you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Never mind if they do.  It is 
only the Palmers.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Charlotte is very pretty, I can tell 
you.  You may see her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if you look this way.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As Elinor was certain of seeing her 
in a couple</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of minutes, without taking that liberty, 
she begged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be excused.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Where is Marianne? Has she run 
away because we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are come? I see her instrument is 
open.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She is walking, I believe.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were now joined by Mrs. Jennings, 
who had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">patience enough to wait till the door 
was opened before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she told HER story.  She came hallooing 
to the window,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How do you do, my dear?  How 
does Mrs. Dashwood do?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And where are your sisters?  What! 
all alone! you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will be glad of a little company to 
sit with you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have brought my other son and daughter 
to see you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Only think of their coming so suddenly!  
I thought I heard</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a carriage last night, while we were 
drinking our tea,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it never entered my head that 
it could be them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I thought of nothing but whether it 
might not be Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon come back again; so I said 
to Sir John, I do think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I hear a carriage; perhaps it is Colonel 
Brandon come</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">back again&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was obliged to turn from her, 
in the middle</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her story, to receive the rest 
of the party; Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton introduced the two strangers; 
Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Margaret came down stairs at the 
same time, and they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all sat down to look at one another, 
while Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">continued her story as she walked 
through the passage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into the parlour, attended by Sir 
John.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer was several years younger 
than Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton, and totally unlike her 
in every respect.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was short and plump, had a very 
pretty face,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the finest expression of good 
humour in it that could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possibly be.  Her manners were by 
no means so elegant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as her sister's, but they were much 
more prepossessing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She came in with a smile, smiled all 
the time of her visit,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">except when she laughed, and smiled 
when she went away.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her husband was a grave looking young 
man of five or six</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and twenty, with an air of more fashion 
and sense than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his wife, but of less willingness 
to please or be pleased.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He entered the room with a look of 
self-consequence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">slightly bowed to the ladies, without 
speaking a word,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and, after briefly surveying them 
and their apartments,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">took up a newspaper from the table, 
and continued to read it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as long as he staid.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer, on the contrary, who 
was strongly endowed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by nature with a turn for being uniformly 
civil and happy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was hardly seated before her admiration 
of the parlour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and every thing in it burst forth.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well! what a delightful room 
this is! I never</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">saw anything so charming!  Only think, 
Mamma, how it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is improved since I was here last! 
I always thought it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such a sweet place, ma'am! (turning 
to Mrs. Dashwood)</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but you have made it so charming!  
Only look, sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how delightful every thing is! How 
I should like such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a house for myself! Should not you, 
Mr. Palmer?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Palmer made her no answer, and 
did not even raise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his eyes from the newspaper.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mr. Palmer does not hear me,&quot; 
said she, laughing;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;he never does sometimes.  It 
is so ridiculous!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This was quite a new idea to Mrs. 
Dashwood; she had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never been used to find wit in the 
inattention of any one,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and could not help looking with surprise 
at them both.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings, in the meantime, talked 
on as loud</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she could, and continued her account 
of their surprise,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the evening before, on seeing their 
friends, without</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ceasing till every thing was told.  
Mrs. Palmer laughed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">heartily at the recollection of their 
astonishment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and every body agreed, two or three 
times over, that it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been quite an agreeable surprise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You may believe how glad we 
all were to see them,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">added Mrs. Jennings, leaning forward 
towards Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and speaking in a low voice as if 
she meant to be heard</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by no one else, though they were seated 
on different sides</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the room; &quot;but, however, I 
can't help wishing they had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not travelled quite so fast, nor made 
such a long journey</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it, for they came all round by 
London upon account</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of some business, for you know (nodding 
significantly and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pointing to her daughter) it was wrong 
in her situation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I wanted her to stay at home and rest 
this morning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but she would come with us; she longed 
so much to see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you all!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer laughed, and said it would 
not do her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any harm.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She expects to be confined in 
February,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">continued Mrs. Jennings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton could no longer endure 
such a conversation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and therefore exerted herself to ask 
Mr. Palmer if there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was any news in the paper.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, none at all,&quot; he replied, 
and read on.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Here comes Marianne,&quot; cried 
Sir John. &quot;Now, Palmer,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you shall see a monstrous pretty girl.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He immediately went into the passage, 
opened the front door,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and ushered her in himself. Mrs. Jennings 
asked her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as she appeared, if she had 
not been to Allenham;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Palmer laughed so heartily 
at the question,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as to show she understood it. Mr. 
Palmer looked up</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her entering the room, stared at 
her some minutes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and then returned to his newspaper.  
Mrs. Palmer's eye</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was now caught by the drawings which 
hung round the room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She got up to examine them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! dear, how beautiful these 
are!  Well! how delightful!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Do but look, mama, how sweet! I declare 
they are quite charming;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I could look at them for ever.&quot; 
And then sitting down again,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she very soon forgot that there were 
any such things in the room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When Lady Middleton rose to go away, 
Mr. Palmer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rose also, laid down the newspaper, 
stretched himself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and looked at them all around.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My love, have you been asleep?&quot; 
said his wife, laughing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He made her no answer; and only observed, 
after again</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">examining the room, that it was very 
low pitched,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that the ceiling was crooked.  
He then made his bow,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and departed with the rest.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John had been very urgent with 
them all to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spend the next day at the park.  Mrs. 
Dashwood, who did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not chuse to dine with them oftener 
than they dined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the cottage, absolutely refused 
on her own account;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her daughters might do as they pleased.  
But they had no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">curiosity to see how Mr. and Mrs. 
Palmer ate their dinner,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and no expectation of pleasure from 
them in any other way.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They attempted, therefore, likewise, 
to excuse themselves;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the weather was uncertain, and not 
likely to be good.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Sir John would not be satisfied--the 
carriage should</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be sent for them and they must come.  
Lady Middleton too, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though she did not press their mother, 
pressed them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings and Mrs. Palmer joined 
their entreaties, all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed equally anxious to avoid a 
family party; and the young</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ladies were obliged to yield.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why should they ask us?&quot; 
said Marianne, as soon as they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were gone.  &quot;The rent of this 
cottage is said to be low;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but we have it on very hard terms, 
if we are to dine</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the park whenever any one is staying 
either with them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or with us.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;They mean no less to be civil 
and kind to us now,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Elinor, &quot;by these frequent 
invitations, than by</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">those which we received from them 
a few weeks ago.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The alteration is not in them, if 
their parties are grown</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tedious and dull.  We must look for 
the change elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 20</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As the Miss Dashwoods entered the 
drawing-room of the park</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the next day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer 
came running in at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the other, looking as good humoured 
and merry as before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She took them all most affectionately 
by the hand,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and expressed great delight in seeing 
them again.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am so glad to see you!&quot; 
said she, seating herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">between Elinor and Marianne, &quot;for 
it is so bad a day I was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">afraid you might not come, which would 
be a shocking thing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as we go away again tomorrow. We must 
go, for the Westons</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">come to us next week you know.  It 
was quite a sudden thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">our coming at all, and I knew nothing 
of it till the carriage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was coming to the door, and then Mr. 
Palmer asked me if I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would go with him to Barton.  He is 
so droll! He never</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tells me any thing! I am so sorry 
we cannot stay longer;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however we shall meet again in town 
very soon, I hope.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were obliged to put an end to 
such an expectation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Not go to town!&quot; cried 
Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I shall be quite disappointed 
if you do not.  I could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">get the nicest house in world for 
you, next door to ours,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Hanover-square.  You must come, 
indeed.  I am sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I shall be very happy to chaperon 
you at any time till</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should 
not like to go</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into public.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They thanked her; but were obliged 
to resist all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her entreaties.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, my love,&quot; cried Mrs. 
Palmer to her husband,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who just then entered the room--&quot;you 
must help me to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go 
to town this winter.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her love made no answer; and after 
slightly bowing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the ladies, began complaining of 
the weather.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How horrid all this is!&quot; 
said he. &quot;Such weather</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">makes every thing and every body disgusting.  
Dullness </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is as much produced within doors as 
without, by rain.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It makes one detest all one's acquaintance.  
What the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">devil does Sir John mean by not having 
a billiard room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his house?  How few people know 
what comfort is!  Sir</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">John is as stupid as the weather.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The rest of the company soon dropt 
in.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am afraid, Miss Marianne,&quot; 
said Sir John, &quot;you have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not been able to take your usual walk 
to Allenham today.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne looked very grave and said 
nothing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, don't be so sly before us,&quot; 
said Mrs. Palmer;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;for we know all about it, I 
assure you; and I admire your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">taste very much, for I think he is 
extremely handsome.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">We do not live a great way from him 
in the country, you know.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Not above ten miles, I dare say.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Much nearer thirty,&quot; said 
her husband.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ah, well! there is not much 
difference.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I never was at his house; but they 
say it is a sweet</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pretty place.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;As vile a spot as I ever saw 
in my life,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Mr. Palmer.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne remained perfectly silent, 
though her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">countenance betrayed her interest 
in what was said.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is it very ugly?&quot; continued 
Mrs. Palmer--&quot;then it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be some other place that is so 
pretty I suppose.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When they were seated in the dining 
room, Sir John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">observed with regret that they were 
only eight all together.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My dear,&quot; said he to his 
lady, &quot;it is very provoking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that we should be so few.  Why did 
not you ask the Gilberts</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to come to us today?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did not I tell you, Sir John, 
when you spoke to me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about it before, that it could not 
be done?  They dined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with us last.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You and I, Sir John,&quot; said 
Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;should not stand upon such ceremony.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Then you would be very ill-bred,&quot;cried 
Mr. Palmer.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My love you contradict every 
body,&quot;said his wife</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with her usual laugh. &quot;Do you 
know that you are quite rude?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I did not know I contradicted 
any body in calling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your mother ill-bred.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ay, you may abuse me as you 
please,&quot; said the good-natured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">old lady, &quot;you have taken Charlotte 
off my hands, and cannot</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">give her back again.  So there I have 
the whip hand of you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Charlotte laughed heartily to think 
that her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">husband could not get rid of her; 
and exultingly said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she did not care how cross he was 
to her, as they must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">live together.  It was impossible 
for any one to be more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thoroughly good-natured, or more determined 
to be happy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than Mrs. Palmer.  The studied indifference, 
insolence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and discontent of her husband gave 
her no pain;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and when he scolded or abused her, 
she was highly diverted.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mr. Palmer is so droll!&quot; 
said she, in a whisper,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Elinor.  &quot;He is always out 
of humour.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was not inclined, after a little 
observation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to give him credit for being so genuinely 
and unaffectedly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ill-natured or ill-bred as he wished 
to appear.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His temper might perhaps be a little 
soured by finding,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">like many others of his sex, that 
through some unaccountable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bias in favour of beauty, he was the 
husband of a very silly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">woman,--but she knew that this kind 
of blunder was too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">common for any sensible man to be 
lastingly hurt by it.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was rather a wish of distinction, 
she believed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which produced his contemptuous treatment 
of every body,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his general abuse of every thing 
before him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was the desire of appearing superior 
to other people.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The motive was too common to be wondered 
at; but the means,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however they might succeed by establishing 
his superiority</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in ill-breeding, were not likely to 
attach any one to him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">except his wife.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,&quot; 
said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have got such a favour to 
ask of you and your sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Will you come and spend some time 
at Cleveland this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Christmas? Now, pray do,--and come 
while the Westons are</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with us.  You cannot think how happy 
I shall be!  It will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be quite delightful!--My love,&quot; 
applying to her husband,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;don't you long to have the Miss 
Dashwoods come to Cleveland?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly,&quot; he replied, 
with a sneer--&quot;I came</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into Devonshire with no other view.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There now,&quot;--said his lady, 
&quot;you see Mr. Palmer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expects you; so you cannot refuse 
to come.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They both eagerly and resolutely declined 
her invitation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But indeed you must and shall 
come.  I am sure you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will like it of all things. The Westons 
will be with us,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it will be quite delightful.  
You cannot think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what a sweet place Cleveland is; and 
we are so gay now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Mr. Palmer is always going about 
the country canvassing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against the election; and so many 
people came to dine</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with us that I never saw before, it 
is quite charming!  But,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">poor fellow! it is very fatiguing 
to him! for he is forced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make every body like him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could hardly keep her countenance 
as she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assented to the hardship of such an 
obligation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How charming it will be,&quot; 
said Charlotte,&quot;when he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is in Parliament!--won't it? How I 
shall laugh!  It will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be so ridiculous to see all his letters 
directed to him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with an M.P.--But do you know, he 
says, he will never frank</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for me?  He declares he won't.  Don't 
you, Mr. Palmer?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Palmer took no notice of her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He cannot bear writing, you 
know,&quot; she continued--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;he says it is quite shocking.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No,&quot; said he, &quot;I never 
said any thing so irrational.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Don't palm all your abuses of languages 
upon me.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There now; you see how droll 
he is.  This is always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the way with him!  Sometimes he won't 
speak to me for half</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a day together, and then he comes 
out with something</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so droll--all about any thing in the 
world.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She surprised Elinor very much as 
they returned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into the drawing-room, by asking her 
whether she did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not like Mr. Palmer excessively.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly,&quot;said Elinor; 
&quot;he seems very agreeable.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well--I am so glad you do.  
I thought you would,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he is so pleasant; and Mr. Palmer 
is excessively pleased</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with you and your sisters I can tell 
you, and you can't</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think how disappointed he will be 
if you don't come</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Cleveland.--I can't imagine why 
you should object</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was again obliged to decline 
her invitation;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and by changing the subject, put a 
stop to her entreaties.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She thought it probable that as they 
lived in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">same county, Mrs. Palmer might be 
able to give some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more particular account of Willoughby's 
general</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">character, than could be gathered 
from the Middletons'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">partial acquaintance with him; and 
she was eager to gain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from any one, such a confirmation 
of his merits as might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">remove the possibility of fear from 
Marianne.  She began</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by inquiring if they saw much of Mr. 
Willoughby at Cleveland,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and whether they were intimately acquainted 
with him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh dear, yes; I know him extremely 
well,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">replied Mrs. Palmer;--&quot;Not that 
I ever spoke</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to him, indeed; but I have seen him 
for ever in town.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Somehow or other I never happened 
to be staying at Barton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while he was at Allenham.  Mama saw 
him here once before;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but I was with my uncle at Weymouth.  
However, I dare say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">we should have seen a great deal of 
him in Somersetshire,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if it had not happened very unluckily 
that we should never</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been in the country together.  
He is very little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Combe, I believe; but if he were 
ever so much there,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I do not think Mr. Palmer would visit 
him, for he is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the opposition, you know, and besides 
it is such a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">way off. I know why you inquire about 
him, very well;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your sister is to marry him.  I am 
monstrous glad of it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for then I shall have her for a neighbour 
you know.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon my word,&quot; replied 
Elinor, &quot;you know much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more of the matter than I do, if you 
have any reason</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to expect such a match.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Don't pretend to deny it, because 
you know it is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what every body talks of.  I assure 
you I heard of it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in my way through town.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My dear Mrs. Palmer!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon my honour I did.--I met 
Colonel Brandon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Monday morning in Bond-street, just 
before we left town,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he told me of it directly.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You surprise me very much.  
Colonel Brandon tell</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you of it!  Surely you must be mistaken.  
To give such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intelligence to a person who could 
not be interested in it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even if it were true, is not what 
I should expect Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon to do.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But I do assure you it was so, 
for all that,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I will tell you how it happened.  
When we met him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he turned back and walked with us; 
and so we began talking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of my brother and sister, and one 
thing and another,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I said to him, 'So, Colonel, there 
is a new family</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">come to Barton cottage, I hear, and 
mama sends me word</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they are very pretty, and that one 
of them is going to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe 
Magna.  Is it true,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pray? for of course you must know, 
as you have been in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Devonshire so lately.'&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And what did the Colonel say?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh--he did not say much; but 
he looked as if he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">knew it to be true, so from that moment 
I set it down</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as certain. It will be quite delightful, 
I declare!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When is it to take place?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mr. Brandon was very well I 
hope?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! yes, quite well; and so 
full of your praises,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he did nothing but say fine things 
of you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am flattered by his commendation.  
He seems</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an excellent man; and I think him 
uncommonly pleasing.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;So do I.--He is such a charming 
man, that it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is quite a pity he should be so grave 
and so dull.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mamma says HE was in love with your 
sister too.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I assure you it was a great compliment 
if he was, for he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hardly ever falls in love with any 
body.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is Mr. Willoughby much known 
in your part</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Somersetshire?&quot; said Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! yes, extremely well; that 
is, I do not believe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">many people are acquainted with him, 
because Combe Magna</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is so far off; but they all think 
him extremely agreeable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I assure you.  Nobody is more liked 
than Mr. Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wherever he goes, and so you may tell 
your sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She is a monstrous lucky girl to get 
him, upon my honour;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not but that he is much more lucky 
in getting her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because she is so very handsome and 
agreeable, that nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can be good enough for her.  However, 
I don't think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her hardly at all handsomer than you, 
I assure you;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I think you both excessively pretty, 
and so does</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Palmer too I am sure, though we 
could not get him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to own it last night.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer's information respecting 
Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not very material; but any testimony 
in his favour,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however small, was pleasing to her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am so glad we are got acquainted 
at last,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">continued Charlotte.--&quot;And now 
I hope we shall always be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great friends.  You can't think how 
much I longed to see you!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is so delightful that you should 
live at the cottage!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nothing can be like it, to be sure!  
And I am so glad</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your sister is going to be well married!  
I hope you will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be a great deal at Combe Magna.  It 
is a sweet place,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by all accounts.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You have been long acquainted 
with Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have not you?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, a great while; ever since 
my sister married.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was a particular friend of Sir 
John's. I believe,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she added in a low voice, &quot;he 
would have been very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">glad to have had me, if he could.  
Sir John and Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton wished it very much.  But 
mama did not think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the match good enough for me, otherwise 
Sir John would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have mentioned it to the Colonel, 
and we should have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">married immediately.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did not Colonel Brandon know 
of Sir John's proposal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to your mother before it was made?  
Had he never owned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his affection to yourself?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, no; but if mama had not 
objected to it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I dare say he would have liked it 
of all things.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He had not seen me then above twice, 
for it was before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I left school.  However, I am much 
happier as I am.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Palmer is the kind of man I like.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 21</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Palmers returned to Cleveland 
the next day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the two families at Barton were 
again left to entertain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">each other. But this did not last 
long; Elinor had hardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">got their last visitors out of her 
head, had hardly done</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wondering at Charlotte's being so 
happy without a cause,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Mr. Palmer's acting so simply, 
with good abilities,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and at the strange unsuitableness 
which often existed between</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">husband and wife, before Sir John's 
and Mrs. Jennings's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">active zeal in the cause of society, 
procured her some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other new acquaintance to see and 
observe.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In a morning's excursion to Exeter, 
they had met with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two young ladies, whom Mrs. Jennings 
had the satisfaction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of discovering to be her relations, 
and this was enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Sir John to invite them directly 
to the park,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as their present engagements 
at Exeter were over.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their engagements at Exeter instantly 
gave way before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such an invitation, and Lady Middleton 
was thrown into</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no little alarm on the return of Sir 
John, by hearing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she was very soon to receive 
a visit from two girls</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whom she had never seen in her life, 
and of whose elegance,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whose tolerable gentility even, she 
could have no proof;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the assurances of her husband 
and mother on that subject</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">went for nothing at all.  Their being 
her relations too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made it so much the worse; and Mrs. 
Jennings's attempts</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at consolation were therefore unfortunately 
founded,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when she advised her daughter not 
to care about their being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so fashionable; because they were 
all cousins and must put</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">up with one another.  As it was impossible, 
however, now to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">prevent their coming, Lady Middleton 
resigned herself to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">idea of it, with all the philosophy 
of a well-bred woman,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">contenting herself with merely giving 
her husband a gentle</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reprimand on the subject five or six 
times every day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The young ladies arrived: their appearance 
was by</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no means ungenteel or unfashionable.  
Their dress was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very smart, their manners very civil, 
they were delighted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the house, and in raptures with 
the furniture,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and they happened to be so doatingly 
fond of children</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Lady Middleton's good opinion 
was engaged in their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">favour before they had been an hour 
at the Park.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She declared them to be very agreeable 
girls indeed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which for her ladyship was enthusiastic 
admiration.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John's confidence in his own judgment 
rose with this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">animated praise, and he set off directly 
for the cottage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to tell the Miss Dashwoods of the 
Miss Steeles' arrival,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to assure them of their being 
the sweetest girls</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world.  From such commendation 
as this, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there was not much to be learned; 
Elinor well knew</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that the sweetest girls in the world 
were to be met</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with in every part of England, under 
every possible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">variation of form, face, temper and 
understanding.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John wanted the whole family to 
walk to the Park directly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and look at his guests. Benevolent, 
philanthropic man! It</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was painful to him even to keep a 
third cousin to himself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do come now,&quot; said he--&quot;pray 
come--you must come--I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">declare you shall come--You can't 
think how you will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">like them.  Lucy is monstrous pretty, 
and so good humoured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and agreeable!  The children are all 
hanging about her already,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as if she was an old acquaintance.  
And they both long</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see you of all things, for they 
have heard at Exeter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that you are the most beautiful creatures 
in the world;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I have told them it is all very 
true, and a great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">deal more.  You will be delighted 
with them I am sure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They have brought the whole coach 
full of playthings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the children. How can you be so 
cross as not to come?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Why they are your cousins, you know, 
after a fashion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">YOU are my cousins, and they are my 
wife's, so you must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be related.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Sir John could not prevail.  He 
could only obtain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a promise of their calling at the 
Park within a day or two,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and then left them in amazement at 
their indifference,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to walk home and boast anew of their 
attractions to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Steeles, as he had been already 
boasting of the Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Steeles to them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When their promised visit to the Park 
and consequent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">introduction to these young ladies 
took place, they found</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the appearance of the eldest, who 
was nearly thirty,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a very plain and not a sensible 
face, nothing to admire;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but in the other, who was not more 
than two or three</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and twenty, they acknowledged considerable 
beauty; her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">features were pretty, and she had 
a sharp quick eye,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a smartness of air, which though 
it did not give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">actual elegance or grace, gave distinction 
to her person.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their manners were particularly civil, 
and Elinor soon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">allowed them credit for some kind 
of sense, when she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">saw with what constant and judicious 
attention they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were making themselves agreeable to 
Lady Middleton.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With her children they were in continual 
raptures,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">extolling their beauty, courting their 
notice, and humouring</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their whims; and such of their time 
as could be spared from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the importunate demands which this 
politeness made on it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was spent in admiration of whatever 
her ladyship was doing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if she happened to be doing any thing, 
or in taking patterns</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of some elegant new dress, in which 
her appearance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the day before had thrown them into 
unceasing delight.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fortunately for those who pay their 
court through</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such foibles, a fond mother, though, 
in pursuit of praise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her children, the most rapacious 
of human beings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is likewise the most credulous; her 
demands are exorbitant;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but she will swallow any thing; and 
the excessive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection and endurance of the Miss 
Steeles towards</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her offspring were viewed therefore 
by Lady Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without the smallest surprise or distrust.  
She saw with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">maternal complacency all the impertinent 
encroachments</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and mischievous tricks to which her 
cousins submitted.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She saw their sashes untied, their 
hair pulled about</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their ears, their work-bags searched, 
and their knives</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and scissors stolen away, and felt 
no doubt of its being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a reciprocal enjoyment.  It suggested 
no other surprise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than that Elinor and Marianne should 
sit so composedly by,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without claiming a share in what was 
passing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;John is in such spirits today!&quot; 
said she, on his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">taking Miss Steeles's pocket handkerchief, 
and throwing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it out of window--&quot;He is full 
of monkey tricks.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And soon afterwards, on the second 
boy's violently</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pinching one of the same lady's fingers, 
she fondly observed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How playful William is!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And here is my sweet little 
Annamaria,&quot; she added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tenderly caressing a little girl of 
three years old,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who had not made a noise for the last 
two minutes;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And she is always so gentle 
and quiet--Never was there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such a quiet little thing!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But unfortunately in bestowing these 
embraces,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a pin in her ladyship's head dress 
slightly scratching</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the child's neck, produced from this 
pattern of gentleness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such violent screams, as could hardly 
be outdone by any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">creature professedly noisy.  The mother's 
consternation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was excessive; but it could not surpass 
the alarm of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Steeles, and every thing was 
done by all three,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in so critical an emergency, which 
affection could suggest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as likely to assuage the agonies of 
the little sufferer.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was seated in her mother's lap, 
covered with kisses,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her wound bathed with lavender-water, 
by one of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Steeles, who was on her knees 
to attend her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her mouth stuffed with sugar plums 
by the other.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With such a reward for her tears, 
the child was too wise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to cease crying. She still screamed 
and sobbed lustily,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">kicked her two brothers for offering 
to touch her, and all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their united soothings were ineffectual 
till Lady Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">luckily remembering that in a scene 
of similar distress</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">last week, some apricot marmalade 
had been successfully</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">applied for a bruised temple, the 
same remedy was eagerly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proposed for this unfortunate scratch, 
and a slight</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intermission of screams in the young 
lady on hearing it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gave them reason to hope that it would 
not be rejected.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was carried out of the room therefore 
in her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother's arms, in quest of this medicine, 
and as the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two boys chose to follow, though earnestly 
entreated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by their mother to stay behind, the 
four young ladies</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were left in a quietness which the 
room had not known for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">many hours.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Poor little creatures!&quot; 
said Miss Steele, as soon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as they were gone.  &quot;It might 
have been a very sad accident.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yet I hardly know how,&quot; 
cried Marianne, &quot;unless it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been under totally different circumstances.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But this is the usual way of heightening 
alarm, where there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is nothing to be alarmed at in reality.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What a sweet woman Lady Middleton 
is!&quot; said Lucy Steele.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was silent; it was impossible 
for her to say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what she did not feel, however trivial 
the occasion;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and upon Elinor therefore the whole 
task of telling lies</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when politeness required it, always 
fell.  She did her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">best when thus called on, by speaking 
of Lady Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with more warmth than she felt, though 
with far less than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Lucy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And Sir John too,&quot; cried 
the elder sister, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;what a charming man he is!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Here too, Miss Dashwood's commendation, 
being only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">simple and just, came in without any 
eclat.  She merely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">observed that he was perfectly good 
humoured and friendly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And what a charming little family 
they have! I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never saw such fine children in my 
life.--I declare I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite doat upon them already, and 
indeed I am always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">distractedly fond of children.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I should guess so,&quot; said 
Elinor, with a smile,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;from what I have witnessed this 
morning.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have a notion,&quot; said 
Lucy, &quot;you think the little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middletons rather too much indulged; 
perhaps they may be the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">outside of enough; but it is so natural 
in Lady Middleton;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and for my part, I love to see children 
full of life</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and spirits; I cannot bear them if 
they are tame and quiet.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I confess,&quot; replied Elinor, 
&quot;that while I am at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Barton Park, I never think of tame 
and quiet children</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with any abhorrence.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A short pause succeeded this speech, 
which was first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">broken by Miss Steele, who seemed 
very much disposed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for conversation, and who now said 
rather abruptly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And how do you like Devonshire, 
Miss Dashwood?  I suppose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you were very sorry to leave Sussex.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In some surprise at the familiarity 
of this question,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or at least of the manner in which 
it was spoken,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor replied that she was.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Norland is a prodigious beautiful 
place, is not it?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">added Miss Steele.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We have heard Sir John admire 
it excessively,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Lucy, who seemed to think some 
apology necessary</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the freedom of her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I think every one MUST admire 
it,&quot; replied Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;who ever saw the place; though 
it is not to be supposed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that any one can estimate its beauties 
as we do.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And had you a great many smart 
beaux there?  I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suppose you have not so many in this 
part of the world;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for my part, I think they are a vast 
addition always.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But why should you think,&quot; 
said Lucy, looking ashamed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her sister, &quot;that there are 
not as many genteel young</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">men in Devonshire as Sussex?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Nay, my dear, I'm sure I don't 
pretend to say that there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an't.  I'm sure there's a vast many 
smart beaux in Exeter;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but you know, how could I tell what 
smart beaux there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might be about Norland; and I was 
only afraid the Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dashwoods might find it dull at Barton, 
if they had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so many as they used to have.  But 
perhaps you young ladies</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may not care about the beaux, and 
had as lief be without</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them as with them.  For my part, I 
think they are vastly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">agreeable, provided they dress smart 
and behave civil.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I can't bear to see them dirty 
and nasty.  Now there's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Rose at Exeter, a prodigious smart 
young man,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite a beau, clerk to Mr. Simpson, 
you know, and yet if you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">do but meet him of a morning, he is 
not fit to be seen.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I suppose your brother was quite a 
beau, Miss Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before he married, as he was so rich?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon my word,&quot; replied 
Elinor, &quot;I cannot tell you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I do not perfectly comprehend 
the meaning of the word.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But this I can say, that if he ever 
was a beau before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he married, he is one still for there 
is not the smallest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">alteration in him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! dear! one never thinks of 
married men's being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beaux--they have something else to 
do.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Lord! Anne,&quot; cried her 
sister, &quot;you can talk of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing but beaux;--you will make 
Miss Dashwood believe you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think of nothing else.&quot; And then 
to turn the discourse,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she began admiring the house and the 
furniture.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This specimen of the Miss Steeles 
was enough.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The vulgar freedom and folly of the 
eldest left</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her no recommendation, and as Elinor 
was not blinded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the beauty, or the shrewd look 
of the youngest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her want of real elegance and artlessness, 
she left</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the house without any wish of knowing 
them better.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Not so the Miss Steeles.--They came 
from Exeter, well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">provided with admiration for the use 
of Sir John Middleton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his family, and all his relations, 
and no niggardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proportion was now dealt out to his 
fair cousins, whom they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">declared to be the most beautiful, 
elegant, accomplished,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and agreeable girls they had ever 
beheld, and with whom</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they were particularly anxious to 
be better acquainted.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And to be better acquainted therefore, 
Elinor soon found</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was their inevitable lot, for as Sir 
John was entirely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the side of the Miss Steeles, their 
party would be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too strong for opposition, and that 
kind of intimacy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be submitted to, which consists 
of sitting an hour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or two together in the same room almost 
every day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John could do no more; but he 
did not know that any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more was required: to be together 
was, in his opinion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be intimate, and while his continual 
schemes for their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">meeting were effectual, he had not 
a doubt of their being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">established friends.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To do him justice, he did every thing 
in his power</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to promote their unreserve, by making 
the Miss Steeles</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acquainted with whatever he knew or 
supposed of his cousins'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">situations in the most delicate particulars,--and 
Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had not seen them more than twice, 
before the eldest of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them wished her joy on her sister's 
having been so lucky</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as to make a conquest of a very smart 
beau since she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">came to Barton.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;'Twill be a fine thing to have 
her married so young</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be sure,&quot; said she, &quot;and 
I hear he is quite a beau,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and prodigious handsome. And I hope 
you may have as good</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">luck yourself soon,--but perhaps you 
may have a friend</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the corner already.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not suppose that Sir 
John would be more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nice in proclaiming his suspicions 
of her regard for Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than he had been with respect to Marianne; 
indeed it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rather his favourite joke of the two, 
as being somewhat</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">newer and more conjectural; and since 
Edward's visit,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they had never dined together without 
his drinking to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">best affections with so much significancy 
and so many nods</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and winks, as to excite general attention.  
The letter F--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been likewise invariably brought 
forward, and found</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">productive of such countless jokes, 
that its character</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the wittiest letter in the alphabet 
had been long</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">established with Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Miss Steeles, as she expected, 
had now all the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">benefit of these jokes, and in the 
eldest of them they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">raised a curiosity to know the name 
of the gentleman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">alluded to, which, though often impertinently 
expressed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was perfectly of a piece with her 
general inquisitiveness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into the concerns of their family.  
But Sir John did not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sport long with the curiosity which 
he delighted to raise,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for he had at least as much pleasure 
in telling the name,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as Miss Steele had in hearing it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;His name is Ferrars,&quot; said 
he, in a very audible whisper;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;but pray do not tell it, for 
it's a great secret.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ferrars!&quot;repeated Miss 
Steele; &quot;Mr. Ferrars is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the happy man, is he? What! your sister-in-law's 
brother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood? a very agreeable young 
man to be sure;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I know him very well.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How can you say so, Anne?&quot; 
cried Lucy, who generally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made an amendment to all her sister's 
assertions.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Though we have seen him once 
or twice at my uncle's, it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is rather too much to pretend to know 
him very well.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor heard all this with attention 
and surprise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And who was this uncle?  Where 
did he live?  How came</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they acquainted?&quot;  She wished 
very much to have the subject</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">continued, though she did not chuse 
to join in it herself;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but nothing more of it was said, and 
for the first time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her life, she thought Mrs. Jennings 
deficient either</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in curiosity after petty information, 
or in a disposition</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to communicate it.  The manner in 
which Miss Steele had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spoken of Edward, increased her curiosity; 
for it struck</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her as being rather ill-natured, and 
suggested the suspicion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of that lady's knowing, or fancying 
herself to know something </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to his disadvantage.--But her curiosity 
was unavailing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for no farther notice was taken of 
Mr. Ferrars's name by</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Steele when alluded to, or even 
openly mentioned by Sir</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">John.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 22</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, who had never much toleration 
for any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thing like impertinence, vulgarity, 
inferiority of parts,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or even difference of taste from herself, 
was at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this time particularly ill-disposed, 
from the state</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her spirits, to be pleased with 
the Miss Steeles,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or to encourage their advances; and 
to the invariable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">coldness of her behaviour towards 
them, which checked every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">endeavour at intimacy on their side, 
Elinor principally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attributed that preference of herself 
which soon became</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">evident in the manners of both, but 
especially of Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who missed no opportunity of engaging 
her in conversation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or of striving to improve their acquaintance 
by an easy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and frank communication of her sentiments.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy was naturally clever; her remarks 
were often</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">just and amusing; and as a companion 
for half an hour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor frequently found her agreeable; 
but her powers</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had received no aid from education: 
she was ignorant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and illiterate; and her deficiency 
of all mental improvement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her want of information in the most 
common particulars,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood, 
in spite of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">constant endeavour to appear to advantage.  
Elinor saw,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and pitied her for, the neglect of 
abilities which education</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might have rendered so respectable; 
but she saw, with less</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tenderness of feeling, the thorough 
want of delicacy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of rectitude, and integrity of mind, 
which her attentions,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her assiduities, her flatteries at 
the Park betrayed;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she could have no lasting satisfaction 
in the company</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a person who joined insincerity 
with ignorance;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whose want of instruction prevented 
their meeting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in conversation on terms of equality, 
and whose conduct</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">toward others made every shew of attention 
and deference</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">towards herself perfectly valueless.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You will think my question an 
odd one, I dare say,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Lucy to her one day, as they 
were walking together</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the park to the cottage--&quot;but 
pray, are you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">personally acquainted with your sister-in-law's 
mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor DID think the question a very 
odd one,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her countenance expressed it, 
as she answered that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed!&quot;replied Lucy; &quot;I 
wonder at that, for I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thought you must have seen her at 
Norland sometimes.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me 
what sort of a woman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she is?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No,&quot; returned Elinor, cautious 
of giving her real</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opinion of Edward's mother, and not 
very desirous</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of satisfying what seemed impertinent 
curiosity--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I know nothing of her.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am sure you think me very 
strange, for enquiring</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about her in such a way,&quot; said 
Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she spoke; &quot;but perhaps there 
may be reasons--I wish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I might venture; but however I hope 
you will do me the justice </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of believing that I do not mean to 
be impertinent.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor made her a civil reply, and 
they walked on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a few minutes in silence.  It 
was broken by Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who renewed the subject again by saying, 
with some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hesitation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I cannot bear to have you think 
me impertinently curious.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure I would rather do any thing 
in the world than be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thought so by a person whose good 
opinion is so well worth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">having as yours. And I am sure I should 
not have the smallest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fear of trusting YOU; indeed, I should 
be very glad of your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">advice how to manage in such and uncomfortable 
situation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as I am; but, however, there is no 
occasion to trouble YOU.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sorry you do not happen to know 
Mrs. Ferrars.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am sorry I do NOT,&quot; said 
Elinor, in great astonishment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;if it could be of any use to 
YOU to know my opinion of her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But really I never understood that 
you were at all connected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with that family, and therefore I 
am a little surprised,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I confess, at so serious an inquiry 
into her character.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I dare say you are, and I am 
sure I do not at all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wonder at it.  But if I dared tell 
you all, you would not be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so much surprised.  Mrs. Ferrars is 
certainly nothing to me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at present--but the time MAY come--how 
soon it will come</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must depend upon herself--when we 
may be very intimately</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">connected.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She looked down as she said this, 
amiably bashful,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with only one side glance at her companion 
to observe its</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">effect on her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Elinor, 
&quot;what do you mean?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Are you acquainted with Mr. Robert 
Ferrars?  Can you be?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And she did not feel much delighted 
with the idea of such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a sister-in-law.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No,&quot; replied Lucy, &quot;not 
to Mr. ROBERT Ferrars--I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never saw him in my life; but,&quot; 
fixing her eyes upon Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;to his eldest brother.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that would have been as painful as 
it was strong, had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an immediate disbelief of the assertion 
attended it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She turned towards Lucy in silent 
amazement, unable to divine</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the reason or object of such a declaration; 
and though</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her complexion varied, she stood firm 
in incredulity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and felt in no danger of an hysterical 
fit, or a swoon.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You may well be surprised,&quot; 
continued Lucy;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;for to be sure you could have 
had no idea of it before;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I dare say he never dropped the 
smallest hint of it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to you or any of your family; because 
it was always meant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be a great secret, and I am sure 
has been faithfully</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">kept so by me to this hour. Not a 
soul of all my relations</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know of it but Anne, and I never should 
have mentioned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it to you, if I had not felt the greatest 
dependence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world upon your secrecy; and 
I really thought my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaviour in asking so many questions 
about Mrs. Ferrars</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must seem so odd, that it ought to 
be explained.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And I do not think Mr. Ferrars can 
be displeased,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when he knows I have trusted you, 
because I know he has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the highest opinion in the world of 
all your family,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and looks upon yourself and the other 
Miss Dashwoods quite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as his own sisters.&quot;--She paused.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor for a few moments remained 
silent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her astonishment at what she heard 
was at first too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great for words; but at length forcing 
herself to speak,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to speak cautiously, she said, 
with calmness of manner,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which tolerably well concealed her 
surprise and solicitude--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;May I ask if your engagement 
is of long standing?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We have been engaged these four 
years.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Four years!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, though greatly shocked, still 
felt unable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to believe it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I did not know,&quot; said she, 
&quot;that you were even</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acquainted till the other day.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Our acquaintance, however, is 
of many years date.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was under my uncle's care, you 
know, a considerable while.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your uncle!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes; Mr. Pratt.  Did you never 
hear him talk</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Mr. Pratt?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I think I have,&quot; replied 
Elinor, with an exertion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of spirits, which increased with her 
increase of emotion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He was four years with my uncle, 
who lives at Longstaple,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">near Plymouth.  It was there our acquaintance 
begun,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for my sister and me was often staying 
with my uncle,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it was there our engagement was 
formed, though not till</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a year after he had quitted as a pupil; 
but he was almost</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">always with us afterwards.  I was 
very unwilling to enter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into it, as you may imagine, without 
the knowledge and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">approbation of his mother; but I was 
too young, and loved</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him too well, to be so prudent as 
I ought to have been.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Though you do not know him so well 
as me, Miss Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you must have seen enough of him to 
be sensible he is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very capable of making a woman sincerely 
attached to him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly,&quot; answered Elinor, 
without knowing what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she said; but after a moment's reflection, 
she added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with revived security of Edward's 
honour and love,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her companion's falsehood--&quot;Engaged 
to Mr. Edward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Ferrars!--I confess myself so totally 
surprised at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what you tell me, that really--I beg 
your pardon;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but surely there must be some mistake 
of person or name.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We can mean no other,&quot; 
cried Lucy, smiling. &quot;Mr. Edward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Ferrars, the eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, 
of Park Street,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and brother of your sister-in-law, 
Mrs. John Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is the person I mean; you must allow 
that I am not likely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be deceived as to the name of the 
man on who all my happiness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">depends.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is strange,&quot; replied 
Elinor, in a most painful perplexity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;that I should never have heard 
him even mention your name.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No; considering our situation, 
it was not strange.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Our first care has been to keep the 
matter secret.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You knew nothing of me, or my family, 
and, therefore,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there could be no OCCASION for ever 
mentioning my name</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to you; and, as he was always particularly 
afraid of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister's suspecting any thing, THAT 
was reason enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for his not mentioning it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was silent.--Elinor's security 
sunk; but her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">self-command did not sink with it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Four years you have been engaged,&quot; 
said she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a firm voice.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes; and heaven knows how much 
longer we may have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to wait.  Poor Edward!  It puts him 
quite out of heart.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Then taking a small miniature from 
her pocket, she added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To prevent the possibility of 
mistake, be so good as to look</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at this face.  It does not do him 
justice, to be sure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but yet I think you cannot be deceived 
as to the person</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was drew for.--I have had it above 
these three years.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She put it into her hands as she spoke; 
and when Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">saw the painting, whatever other doubts 
her fear of a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too hasty decision, or her wish of 
detecting falsehood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might suffer to linger in her mind, 
she could have none of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its being Edward's face. She returned 
it almost instantly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acknowledging the likeness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have never been able,&quot; 
continued Lucy, &quot;to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him my picture in return, which I 
am very much vexed at,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for he has been always so anxious 
to get it!  But I am</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">determined to set for it the very 
first opportunity.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are quite in the right,&quot; 
replied Elinor calmly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They then proceeded a few paces in 
silence.  Lucy spoke first.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am sure,&quot; said she, &quot;I 
have no doubt in the world</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of your faithfully keeping this secret, 
because you must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know of what importance it is to us, 
not to have it reach</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his mother; for she would never approve 
of it, I dare say.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I shall have no fortune, and I fancy 
she is an exceeding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proud woman.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I certainly did not seek your 
confidence,&quot; said Elinor;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;but you do me no more than justice 
in imagining that I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may be depended on.  Your secret is 
safe with me;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but pardon me if I express some surprise 
at so unnecessary</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a communication.  You must at least 
have felt that my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being acquainted with it could not 
add to its safety.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As she said this, she looked earnestly 
at Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hoping to discover something in her 
countenance; perhaps the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">falsehood of the greatest part of 
what she had been saying;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Lucy's countenance suffered no 
change.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I was afraid you would think 
I was taking a great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">liberty with you,&quot; said she, 
&quot;in telling you all this.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have not known you long to be sure, 
personally at least,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but I have known you and all your 
family by description</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a great while; and as soon as I saw 
you, I felt almost as if</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you was an old acquaintance. Besides 
in the present case,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I really thought some explanation 
was due to you after my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">making such particular inquiries about 
Edward's mother;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I am so unfortunate, that I have 
not a creature whose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">advice I can ask.  Anne is the only 
person that knows of it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she has no judgment at all; indeed, 
she does me a great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">deal more harm than good, for I am 
in constant fear of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">betraying me.  She does not know how 
to hold her tongue,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as you must perceive, and I am sure 
I was in the greatest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fright in the world t'other day, when 
Edward's name was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mentioned by Sir John, lest she should 
out with it all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You can't think how much I go through 
in my mind from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it altogether.  I only wonder that 
I am alive after what </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have suffered for Edward's sake 
these last four years.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Every thing in such suspense and uncertainty; 
and seeing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him so seldom--we can hardly meet 
above twice a-year.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure I wonder my heart is not 
quite broke.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Here she took out her handkerchief; 
but Elinor did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not feel very compassionate.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Sometimes.&quot;continued Lucy, 
after wiping her eyes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I think whether it would not 
be better for us both</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to break off the matter entirely.&quot;  
As she said this,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she looked directly at her companion.  
&quot;But then</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at other times I have not resolution 
enough for it.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I cannot bear the thoughts of making 
him so miserable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as I know the very mention of such 
a thing would do.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And on my own account too--so dear 
as he is to me--I don't</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think I could be equal to it. What 
would you advise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me to do in such a case, Miss Dashwood?  
What would you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">do yourself?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Pardon me,&quot; replied Elinor, 
startled by the question;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;but I can give you no advice 
under such circumstances.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Your own judgment must direct you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To be sure,&quot; continued 
Lucy, after a few minutes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">silence on both sides, &quot;his mother 
must provide for him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sometime or other; but poor Edward 
is so cast down by it!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Did you not think him dreadful low-spirited 
when he was at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Barton?  He was so miserable when 
he left us at Longstaple,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to go to you, that I was afraid you 
would think him quite ill.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did he come from your uncle's, 
then, when he visited us?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, yes; he had been staying 
a fortnight with us.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Did you think he came directly from 
town?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No,&quot; replied Elinor, most 
feelingly sensible of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every fresh circumstance in favour 
of Lucy's veracity;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I remember he told us, that 
he had been staying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a fortnight with some friends near 
Plymouth.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She remembered too, her own surprise 
at the time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at his mentioning nothing farther 
of those friends,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at his total silence with respect 
even to their names.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did not you think him sadly 
out of spirits?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">repeated Lucy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We did, indeed, particularly 
so when he first arrived.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I begged him to exert himself 
for fear you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should suspect what was the matter; 
but it made him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so melancholy, not being able to stay 
more than a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fortnight with us, and seeing me so 
much affected.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor fellow!--I am afraid it is just 
the same with him now;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for he writes in wretched spirits.  
I heard from him just</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before I left Exeter;&quot; taking 
a letter from her pocket</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and carelessly showing the direction 
to Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You know his hand, I dare say, 
a charming one it is;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but that is not written so well as 
usual.--He was tired,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I dare say, for he had just filled 
the sheet to me as full</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as possible.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor saw that it WAS his hand, and 
she could doubt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no longer.  This picture, she had 
allowed herself to believe,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might have been accidentally obtained; 
it might not have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been Edward's gift; but a correspondence 
between them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by letter, could subsist only under 
a positive engagement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could be authorised by nothing else; 
for a few moments, she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was almost overcome--her heart sunk 
within her, and she could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably 
necessary;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she struggled so resolutely against 
the oppression</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her feelings, that her success 
was speedy, and for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the time complete.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Writing to each other,&quot; 
said Lucy, returning the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">letter into her pocket, &quot;is the 
only comfort we have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in such long separations.  Yes, I 
have one other comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his picture, but poor Edward has 
not even THAT.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If he had but my picture, he says 
he should be easy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I gave him a lock of my hair set in 
a ring when he was at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Longstaple last, and that was some 
comfort to him, he said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but not equal to a picture.  Perhaps 
you might notice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the ring when you saw him?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I did,&quot; said Elinor, with 
a composure of voice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">under which was concealed an emotion 
and distress beyond</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any thing she had ever felt before.  
She was mortified,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shocked, confounded.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fortunately for her, they had now 
reached the cottage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the conversation could be continued 
no farther.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After sitting with them a few minutes, 
the Miss Steeles</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">returned to the Park, and Elinor was 
then at liberty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to think and be wretched.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">However small Elinor's general dependence 
on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy's veracity might be, it was impossible 
for her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on serious reflection to suspect it 
in the present case,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where no temptation could be answerable 
to the folly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of inventing a falsehood of such a 
description.  What Lucy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had asserted to be true, therefore, 
Elinor could not,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dared not longer doubt; supported 
as it was too on every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">side by such probabilities and proofs, 
and contradicted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by nothing but her own wishes.  Their 
opportunity of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt 
was a foundation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the rest, at once indisputable 
and alarming; and Edward's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">visit near Plymouth, his melancholy 
state of mind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his dissatisfaction at his own prospects, 
his uncertain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaviour towards herself, the intimate 
knowledge of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Steeles as to Norland and their 
family connections,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which had often surprised her, the 
picture, the letter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the ring, formed altogether such a 
body of evidence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as overcame every fear of condemning 
him unfairly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and established as a fact, which no 
partiality could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">set aside, his ill-treatment of herself.--Her 
resentment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of such behaviour, her indignation 
at having been its dupe,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a short time made her feel only 
for herself;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but other ideas, other considerations, 
soon arose.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Had Edward been intentionally deceiving 
her?  Had he feigned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a regard for her which he did not 
feel? Was his engagement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Lucy an engagement of the heart?  
No; whatever it might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">once have been, she could not believe 
it such at present.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His affection was all her own.  She 
could not be deceived</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in that.  Her mother, sisters, Fanny, 
all had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conscious of his regard for her at 
Norland; it was not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an illusion of her own vanity.  He 
certainly loved her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What a softener of the heart was this 
persuasion!  How much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could it not tempt her to forgive!  
He had been blamable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">highly blamable, in remaining at Norland 
after he first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">felt her influence over him to be 
more than it ought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be.  In that, he could not be defended; 
but if he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had injured her, how much more had 
he injured himself;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if her case were pitiable, his was 
hopeless.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His imprudence had made her miserable 
for a while; but it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed to have deprived himself of 
all chance of ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being otherwise.  She might in time 
regain tranquillity;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but HE, what had he to look forward 
to?  Could he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ever be tolerably happy with Lucy 
Steele; could he,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were his affection for herself out 
of the question,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with his integrity, his delicacy, 
and well-informed mind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be satisfied with a wife like her--illiterate, 
artful,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and selfish?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The youthful infatuation of nineteen 
would naturally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">blind him to every thing but her beauty 
and good nature;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the four succeeding years--years, 
which if rationally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spent, give such improvement to the 
understanding, must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have opened his eyes to her defects 
of education,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while the same period of time, spent 
on her side</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in inferior society and more frivolous 
pursuits,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity 
which might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">once have given an interesting character 
to her beauty.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If in the supposition of his seeking 
to marry herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his difficulties from his mother had 
seemed great,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how much greater were they now likely 
to be, when</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the object of his engagement was undoubtedly 
inferior </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in connections, and probably inferior 
in fortune to herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">These difficulties, indeed, with a 
heart so alienated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from Lucy, might not press very hard 
upon his patience;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but melancholy was the state of the 
person by whom the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expectation of family opposition and 
unkindness, could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be felt as a relief!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As these considerations occurred to 
her in painful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">succession, she wept for him, more 
than for herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Supported by the conviction of having 
done nothing to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">merit her present unhappiness, and 
consoled by the belief</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Edward had done nothing to forfeit 
her esteem,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she thought she could even now, under 
the first smart</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the heavy blow, command herself 
enough to guard every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suspicion of the truth from her mother 
and sisters.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And so well was she able to answer 
her own expectations,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that when she joined them at dinner 
only two hours</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after she had first suffered the extinction 
of all her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dearest hopes, no one would have supposed 
from the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">appearance of the sisters, that Elinor 
was mourning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in secret over obstacles which must 
divide her for ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the object of her love, and that 
Marianne was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">internally dwelling on the perfections 
of a man, of whose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed, 
and whom she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expected to see in every carriage 
which drove near their house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The necessity of concealing from her 
mother and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, what had been entrusted 
in confidence to herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though it obliged her to unceasing 
exertion, was no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">aggravation of Elinor's distress.  
On the contrary</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was a relief to her, to be spared 
the communication</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what would give such affliction 
to them, and to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">saved likewise from hearing that condemnation 
of Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which would probably flow from the 
excess of their partial</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection for herself, and which was 
more than she felt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">equal to support.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">From their counsel, or their conversation, 
she knew</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could receive no assistance, their 
tenderness and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sorrow must add to her distress, while 
her self-command</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would neither receive encouragement 
from their example</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor from their praise.  She was stronger 
alone,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her own good sense so well supported 
her, that her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">firmness was as unshaken, her appearance 
of cheerfulness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as invariable, as with regrets so 
poignant and so fresh,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was possible for them to be.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Much as she had suffered from her 
first conversation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with Lucy on the subject, she soon 
felt an earnest wish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of renewing it; and this for more 
reasons than one.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She wanted to hear many particulars 
of their engagement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">repeated again, she wanted more clearly 
to understand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what Lucy really felt for Edward, 
whether there were any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sincerity in her declaration of tender 
regard for him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she particularly wanted to convince 
Lucy, by her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">readiness to enter on the matter again, 
and her calmness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in conversing on it, that she was 
no otherwise interested</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in it than as a friend, which she 
very much feared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her involuntary agitation, in their 
morning discourse,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must have left at least doubtful.  
That Lucy was disposed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be jealous of her appeared very 
probable: it was plain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Edward had always spoken highly 
in her praise,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not merely from Lucy's assertion, 
but from her venturing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to trust her on so short a personal 
acquaintance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a secret so confessedly and evidently 
important.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And even Sir John's joking intelligence 
must have had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some weight. But indeed, while Elinor 
remained so well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assured within herself of being really 
beloved by Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it required no other consideration 
of probabilities</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make it natural that Lucy should 
be jealous;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that she was so, her very confidence 
was a proof.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What other reason for the disclosure 
of the affair could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there be, but that Elinor might be 
informed by it of Lucy's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">superior claims on Edward, and be 
taught to avoid him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in future?  She had little difficulty 
in understanding thus</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much of her rival's intentions, and 
while she was firmly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">resolved to act by her as every principle 
of honour and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">honesty directed, to combat her own 
affection for Edward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to see him as little as possible; 
she could not deny</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself the comfort of endeavouring 
to convince Lucy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that her heart was unwounded.  And 
as she could now have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing more painful to hear on the 
subject than had already</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been told, she did not mistrust her 
own ability of going</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">through a repetition of particulars 
with composure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But it was not immediately that an 
opportunity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of doing so could be commanded, though 
Lucy was as well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disposed as herself to take advantage 
of any that occurred;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the weather was not often fine 
enough to allow</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their joining in a walk, where 
they might most easily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">separate themselves from the others; 
and though they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">met at least every other evening either 
at the park</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or cottage, and chiefly at the former, 
they could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not be supposed to meet for the sake 
of conversation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Such a thought would never enter either 
Sir John or Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton's head; and therefore very 
little leisure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was ever given for a general chat, 
and none at all for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">particular discourse.  They met for 
the sake of eating,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">drinking, and laughing together, playing 
at cards,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or consequences, or any other game 
that was sufficiently noisy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One or two meetings of this kind had 
taken place,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without affording Elinor any chance 
of engaging Lucy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in private, when Sir John called at 
the cottage one morning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to beg, in the name of charity, that 
they would all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dine with Lady Middleton that day, 
as he was obliged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to attend the club at Exeter, and 
she would otherwise be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite alone, except her mother and 
the two Miss Steeles.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, who foresaw a fairer opening 
for the point she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had in view, in such a party as this 
was likely to be,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more at liberty among themselves under 
the tranquil</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton 
than when</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her husband united them together in 
one noisy purpose,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately accepted the invitation; 
Margaret, with her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother's permission, was equally compliant, 
and Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though always unwilling to join any 
of their parties,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was persuaded by her mother, who could 
not bear to have her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seclude herself from any chance of 
amusement, to go likewise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton 
was happily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">preserved from the frightful solitude 
which had threatened her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The insipidity of the meeting was 
exactly such as Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had expected; it produced not one 
novelty of thought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or expression, and nothing could be 
less interesting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than the whole of their discourse 
both in the dining</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">parlour and drawing room: to the latter, 
the children</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">accompanied them, and while they remained 
there, she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too well convinced of the impossibility 
of engaging Lucy's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attention to attempt it.  They quitted 
it only with the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">removal of the tea-things. The card-table 
was then placed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor began to wonder at herself 
for having ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entertained a hope of finding time 
for conversation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the park.  They all rose up in 
preparation for a round game.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am glad,&quot; said Lady Middleton 
to Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;you are not going to finish 
poor little Annamaria's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">basket this evening; for I am sure 
it must hurt your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">eyes to work filigree by candlelight.  
And we will make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the dear little love some amends for 
her disappointment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to-morrow, and then I hope she will 
not much mind it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This hint was enough, Lucy recollected 
herself instantly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and replied, &quot;Indeed you are 
very much mistaken,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton; I am only waiting 
to know whether you can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">make your party without me, or I should 
have been at my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">filigree already.  I would not disappoint 
the little angel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for all the world: and if you want 
me at the card-table now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am resolved to finish the basket 
after supper.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are very good, I hope it 
won't hurt your eyes--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will you ring the bell for some working 
candles?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My poor little girl would be sadly 
disappointed, I know,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if the basket was not finished tomorrow, 
for though I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">told her it certainly would not, I 
am sure she depends</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">upon having it done.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy directly drew her work table 
near her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and reseated herself with an alacrity 
and cheerfulness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which seemed to infer that she could 
taste no greater</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">delight than in making a filigree 
basket for a spoilt child.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of 
Casino to the others.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No one made any objection but Marianne, 
who with her usual</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inattention to the forms of general 
civility, exclaimed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your Ladyship will have the 
goodness to excuse ME--you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know I detest cards.  I shall go to 
the piano-forte;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have not touched it since it was 
tuned.&quot;  And without</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">farther ceremony, she turned away 
and walked to the instrument.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton looked as if she thanked 
heaven</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that SHE had never made so rude a 
speech.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Marianne can never keep long 
from that instrument</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know, ma'am,&quot; said Elinor, 
endeavouring to smooth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">away the offence; &quot;and I do not 
much wonder at it; for it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is the very best toned piano-forte 
I ever heard.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The remaining five were now to draw 
their cards.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps,&quot;continued Elinor, 
&quot;if I should happen</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to cut out, I may be of some use to 
Miss Lucy Steele,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in rolling her papers for her; and 
there is so much still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be done to the basket, that it 
must be impossible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I think for her labour singly, to 
finish it this evening.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I should like the work exceedingly, 
if she would allow</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me a share in it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed I shall be very much 
obliged to you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for your help,&quot; cried Lucy,&quot;for 
I find there is more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be done to it than I thought there 
was; and it would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be a shocking thing to disappoint 
dear Annamaria after all.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! that would be terrible, 
indeed,&quot; said Miss Steele--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Dear little soul, how I do love 
her!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are very kind,&quot; said 
Lady Middleton to Elinor;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;and as you really like the work, 
perhaps you will be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as well pleased not to cut in till 
another rubber,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or will you take your chance now?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor joyfully profited by the first 
of these proposals,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and thus by a little of that address 
which Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could never condescend to practise, 
gained her own end,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and pleased Lady Middleton at the 
same time.  Lucy made room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her with ready attention, and 
the two fair rivals were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thus seated side by side at the same 
table, and, with the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding 
the same work.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The pianoforte at which Marianne, 
wrapped up in her own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">music and her own thoughts, had by 
this time forgotten</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that any body was in the room besides 
herself, was luckily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so near them that Miss Dashwood now 
judged she might safely,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">under the shelter of its noise, introduce 
the interesting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subject, without any risk of being 
heard at the card-table.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 24</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In a firm, though cautious tone, Elinor 
thus began.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I should be undeserving of the 
confidence you have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">honoured me with, if I felt no desire 
for its continuance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or no farther curiosity on its subject.  
I will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not apologize therefore for bringing 
it forward again.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Thank you,&quot; cried Lucy 
warmly, &quot;for breaking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the ice; you have set my heart at 
ease by it; for I was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">somehow or other afraid I had offended 
you by what I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">told you that Monday.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Offended me! How could you suppose 
so? Believe me,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor spoke it with the truest 
sincerity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;nothing could be farther from 
my intention than to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you such an idea.  Could you have 
a motive for the trust,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that was not honourable and flattering 
to me?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And yet I do assure you,&quot; 
replied Lucy, her little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sharp eyes full of meaning,&quot;there 
seemed to me to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a coldness and displeasure in your 
manner that made me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite uncomfortable. I felt sure that 
you was angry with me;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and have been quarrelling with myself 
ever since, for having</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">took such a liberty as to trouble 
you with my affairs.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I am very glad to find it was 
only my own fancy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that you really do not blame me.  
If you knew what a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">consolation it was to me to relieve 
my heart speaking to you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what I am always thinking of every 
moment of my life,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your compassion would make you overlook 
every thing else</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed, I can easily believe 
that it was a very great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">relief to you, to acknowledge your 
situation to me, and be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assured that you shall never have 
reason to repent it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Your case is a very unfortunate one; 
you seem to me to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be surrounded with difficulties, and 
you will have need</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all your mutual affection to support 
you under them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Ferrars, I believe, is entirely 
dependent on his mother.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He has only two thousand pounds 
of his own; it would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be madness to marry upon that, though 
for my own part,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I could give up every prospect of 
more without a sigh.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have been always used to a very 
small income, and could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">struggle with any poverty for him; 
but I love him too well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be the selfish means of robbing 
him, perhaps, of all that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his mother might give him if he married 
to please her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">We must wait, it may be for many years.  
With almost every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other man in the world, it would be 
an alarming prospect;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Edward's affection and constancy 
nothing can deprive me of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I know.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That conviction must be every 
thing to you;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he is undoubtedly supported by 
the same trust in your's.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If the strength of your reciprocal 
attachment had failed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as between many people, and under 
many circumstances</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it naturally would during a four years' 
engagement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your situation would have been pitiable, 
indeed.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy here looked up; but Elinor was 
careful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in guarding her countenance from every 
expression</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that could give her words a suspicious 
tendency.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Edward's love for me,&quot; 
said Lucy,&quot;has been pretty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well put to the test, by our long, 
very long absence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">since we were first engaged, and it 
has stood the trial</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so well, that I should be unpardonable 
to doubt it now.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I can safely say that he has never 
gave me one moment's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">alarm on that account from the first.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor hardly knew whether to smile 
or sigh</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at this assertion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy went on. &quot;I am rather of 
a jealous temper too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by nature, and from our different 
situations in life,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from his being so much more in the 
world than me, and our</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">continual separation, I was enough 
inclined for suspicion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to have found out the truth in an 
instant, if there had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the slightest alteration in his behaviour 
to me when we met,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or any lowness of spirits that I could 
not account for,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or if he had talked more of one lady 
than another,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or seemed in any respect less happy 
at Longstaple than he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">used to be.  I do not mean to say 
that I am particularly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">observant or quick-sighted in general, 
but in such a case</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure I could not be deceived.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;All this,&quot; thought Elinor, 
&quot;is very pretty;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it can impose upon neither of 
us.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But what,&quot; said she after 
a short silence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;are your views? or have you 
none but that of waiting for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars's death, which is a melancholy 
and shocking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">extremity?--Is her son determined 
to submit to this,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to all the tediousness of the 
many years of suspense</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in which it may involve you, rather 
than run the risk</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her displeasure for a while by 
owning the truth?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If we could be certain that 
it would be only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a while!  But Mrs. Ferrars is 
a very headstrong</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proud woman, and in her first fit 
of anger upon hearing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it, would very likely secure every 
thing to Robert,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the idea of that, for Edward's 
sake, frightens away</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all my inclination for hasty measures.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And for your own sake too, or 
you are carrying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your disinterestedness beyond reason.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy looked at Elinor again, and was 
silent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do you know Mr. Robert Ferrars?&quot; 
asked Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Not at all--I never saw him; 
but I fancy he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is very unlike his brother--silly 
and a great coxcomb.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;A great coxcomb!&quot; repeated 
Miss Steele, whose ear had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">caught those words by a sudden pause 
in Marianne's music.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, they are talking of their 
favourite beaux, I dare say.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No sister,&quot; cried Lucy, 
&quot;you are mistaken there, our</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">favourite beaux are NOT great coxcombs.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I can answer for it that Miss 
Dashwood's is not,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Mrs. Jennings, laughing heartily; 
&quot;for he is one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the modestest, prettiest behaved 
young men I ever saw;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but as for Lucy, she is such a sly 
little creature,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there is no finding out who SHE likes.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh,&quot;cried Miss Steele, 
looking significantly round</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at them, &quot;I dare say Lucy's beau 
is quite as modest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and pretty behaved as Miss Dashwood's.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor blushed in spite of herself.  
Lucy bit her lip,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and looked angrily at her sister.  
A mutual silence took</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">place for some time.  Lucy first put 
an end to it by saying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a lower tone, though Marianne was 
then giving them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the powerful protection of a very 
magnificent concerto--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I will honestly tell you of 
one scheme which has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lately come into my head, for bringing 
matters to bear;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indeed I am bound to let you into 
the secret, for you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are a party concerned.  I dare say 
you have seen enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Edward to know that he would prefer 
the church to every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other profession; now my plan is that 
he should take</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">orders as soon as he can, and then 
through your interest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which I am sure you would be kind 
enough to use out of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">friendship for him, and I hope out 
of some regard to me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your brother might be persuaded to 
give him Norland living;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which I understand is a very good 
one, and the present</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">incumbent not likely to live a great 
while.  That would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be enough for us to marry upon, and 
we might trust to time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and chance for the rest.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I should always be happy,&quot;replied 
Elinor, &quot;to show</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any mark of my esteem and friendship 
for Mr. Ferrars;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but do you not perceive that my interest 
on such an</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">occasion would be perfectly unnecessary?  
He is brother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Mrs. John Dashwood--THAT must be 
recommendation enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her husband.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But Mrs. John Dashwood would 
not much approve</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Edward's going into orders.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Then I rather suspect that my 
interest would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">do very little.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were again silent for many minutes.  
At length</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy exclaimed with a deep sigh,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I believe it would be the wisest 
way to put an end</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the business at once by dissolving 
the engagement.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">We seem so beset with difficulties 
on every side,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that though it would make us miserable 
for a time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">we should be happier perhaps in the 
end.  But you will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not give me your advice, Miss Dashwood?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No,&quot;answered Elinor, with 
a smile, which concealed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very agitated feelings,&quot;on such 
a subject I certainly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will not.  You know very well that 
my opinion would have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no weight with you, unless it were 
on the side of your wishes.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed you wrong me,&quot; replied 
Lucy, with great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">solemnity; &quot;I know nobody of 
whose judgment I think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so highly as I do of yours; and I 
do really believe,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that if you was to say to me, 'I advise 
you by all means</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to put an end to your engagement with 
Edward Ferrars,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it will be more for the happiness 
of both of you,'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I should resolve upon doing it immediately.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor blushed for the insincerity 
of Edward's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">future wife, and replied, &quot;This 
compliment would effectually</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">frighten me from giving any opinion 
on the subject</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had I formed one.  It raises my influence 
much too high;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the power of dividing two people so 
tenderly attached</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is too much for an indifferent person.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;'Tis because you are an indifferent 
person,&quot; said Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with some pique, and laying a particular 
stress on those words,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;that your judgment might justly 
have such weight with me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If you could be supposed to be biased 
in any respect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by your own feelings, your opinion 
would not be worth having.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor thought it wisest to make no 
answer to this,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lest they might provoke each other 
to an unsuitable increase</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of ease and unreserve; and was even 
partly determined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never to mention the subject again.  
Another pause</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">therefore of many minutes' duration, 
succeeded this speech,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Lucy was still the first to end 
it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Shall you be in town this winter, 
Miss Dashwood?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said she with all her accustomary 
complacency.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly not.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am sorry for that,&quot; returned 
the other,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while her eyes brightened at the information,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;it would have gave me such pleasure 
to meet you there!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I dare say you will go for all 
that.  To be sure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your brother and sister will ask you 
to come to them.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It will not be in my power to 
accept their invitation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if they do.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How unlucky that is! I had quite 
depended upon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">meeting you there.  Anne and me are 
to go the latter end</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of January to some relations who have 
been wanting us to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">visit them these several years!  But 
I only go for the sake</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of seeing Edward.  He will be there 
in February, otherwise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">London would have no charms for me; 
I have not spirits for it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was soon called to the card-table 
by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conclusion of the first rubber, and 
the confidential</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">discourse of the two ladies was therefore 
at an end,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to which both of them submitted without 
any reluctance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for nothing had been said on either 
side to make them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dislike each other less than they 
had done before;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor sat down to the card table 
with the melancholy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">persuasion that Edward was not only 
without affection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the person who was to be his wife; 
but that he had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not even the chance of being tolerably 
happy in marriage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which sincere affection on HER side 
would have given,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for self-interest alone could induce 
a woman to keep a man</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to an engagement, of which she seemed 
so thoroughly aware</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he was weary.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">From this time the subject was never 
revived by Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and when entered on by Lucy, who seldom 
missed an opportunity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of introducing it, and was particularly 
careful to inform</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her confidante, of her happiness whenever 
she received a letter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from Edward, it was treated by the 
former with calmness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and caution, and dismissed as soon 
as civility would allow;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for she felt such conversations to 
be an indulgence which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy did not deserve, and which were 
dangerous to herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The visit of the Miss Steeles at Barton 
Park was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lengthened far beyond what the first 
invitation implied.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their favour increased; they could 
not be spared;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John would not hear of their going; 
and in spite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their numerous and long arranged 
engagements in Exeter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in spite of the absolute necessity 
of returning to fulfill</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them immediately, which was in full 
force at the end</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of every week, they were prevailed 
on to stay nearly two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">months at the park, and to assist 
in the due celebration</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of that festival which requires a 
more than ordinary</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">share of private balls and large dinners 
to proclaim</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its importance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 25</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit 
of spending a large</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">portion of the year at the houses 
of her children and friends,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was not without a settled habitation 
of her own.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Since the death of her husband, who 
had traded with success</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a less elegant part of the town, 
she had resided every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">winter in a house in one of the streets 
near Portman Square.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Towards this home, she began on the 
approach of January</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to turn her thoughts, and thither 
she one day abruptly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and very unexpectedly by them, asked 
the elder Misses</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dashwood to accompany her.  Elinor, 
without observing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the varying complexion of her sister, 
and the animated look</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which spoke no indifference to the 
plan, immediately gave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a grateful but absolute denial for 
both, in which she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">believed herself to be speaking their 
united inclinations.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The reason alleged was their determined 
resolution</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of not leaving their mother at that 
time of the year.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings received the refusal 
with some surprise,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and repeated her invitation immediately.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother 
can spare you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very well, and I DO beg you will favour 
me with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your company, for I've quite set my 
heart upon it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Don't fancy that you will be any inconvenience 
to me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I shan't put myself at all out 
of my way for you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It will only be sending Betty by the 
coach, and I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hope I can afford THAT.  We three 
shall be able to go</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very well in my chaise; and when we 
are in town,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if you do not like to go wherever 
I do, well and good,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you may always go with one of my daughters.  
I am sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your mother will not object to it; 
for I have had such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good luck in getting my own children 
off my hands that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will think me a very fit person to 
have the charge of you;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if I don't get one of you at least 
well married</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before I have done with you, it shall 
not be my fault.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I shall speak a good word for you 
to all the young men,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you may depend upon it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have a notion,&quot; said 
Sir John, &quot;that Miss Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would not object to such a scheme, 
if her elder sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would come into it.  It is very hard 
indeed that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should not have a little pleasure, 
because Miss Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">does not wish it.  So I would advise 
you two, to set off</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for town, when you are tired of Barton, 
without saying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a word to Miss Dashwood about it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Nay,&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings, 
&quot;I am sure I shall be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">monstrous glad of Miss Marianne's 
company, whether Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dashwood will go or not, only the 
more the merrier say I,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I thought it would be more comfortable 
for them to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be together; because, if they got 
tired of me, they might talk</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to one another, and laugh at my old 
ways behind my back.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But one or the other, if not both 
of them, I must have.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lord bless me! how do you think I 
can live poking by myself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I who have been always used till this 
winter to have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Charlotte with me.  Come, Miss Marianne, 
let us strike</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hands upon the bargain, and if Miss 
Dashwood will change</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her mind by and bye, why so much the 
better.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I thank you, ma'am, sincerely 
thank you,&quot; said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with warmth: &quot;your invitation 
has insured my gratitude for ever,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it would give me such happiness, 
yes, almost the greatest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happiness I am capable of, to be able 
to accept it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But my mother, my dearest, kindest 
mother,--I feel the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">justice of what Elinor has urged, 
and if she were to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made less happy, less comfortable 
by our absence--Oh! no,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing should tempt me to leave her.  
It should not,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must not be a struggle.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings repeated her assurance 
that Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could spare them perfectly well; and 
Elinor, who now</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">understood her sister, and saw to 
what indifference to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost every thing else she was carried 
by her eagerness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be with Willoughby again, made 
no farther direct</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opposition to the plan, and merely 
referred it to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother's decision, from whom however 
she scarcely expected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to receive any support in her endeavour 
to prevent a visit,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which she could not approve of for 
Marianne, and which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her own account she had particular 
reasons to avoid.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Whatever Marianne was desirous of, 
her mother would be eager</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to promote--she could not expect to 
influence the latter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to cautiousness of conduct in an affair 
respecting which she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had never been able to inspire her 
with distrust; and she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dared not explain the motive of her 
own disinclination</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for going to London.  That Marianne, 
fastidious as she was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thoroughly acquainted with Mrs. Jennings' 
manners,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and invariably disgusted by them, 
should overlook every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inconvenience of that kind, should 
disregard whatever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be most wounding to her irritable 
feelings, in her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pursuit of one object, was such a 
proof, so strong,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so full, of the importance of that 
object to her, as Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in spite of all that had passed, was 
not prepared to witness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On being informed of the invitation, 
Mrs. Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">persuaded that such an excursion would 
be productive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of much amusement to both her daughters, 
and perceiving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">through all her affectionate attention 
to herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how much the heart of Marianne was 
in it, would not hear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their declining the offer upon 
HER account; insisted on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their both accepting it directly; 
and then began to foresee,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with her usual cheerfulness, a variety 
of advantages that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would accrue to them all, from this 
separation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am delighted with the plan,&quot;she 
cried,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;it is exactly what I could wish.  
Margaret and I shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be as much benefited by it as yourselves.  
When you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the Middletons are gone, we shall 
go on so quietly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and happily together with our books 
and our music! You</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will find Margaret so improved when 
you come back again!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have a little plan of alteration 
for your bedrooms too,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which may now be performed without 
any inconvenience</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to any one.  It is very right that 
you SHOULD go to town;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I would have every young woman of 
your condition in life</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acquainted with the manners and amusements 
of London.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You will be under the care of a motherly 
good sort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of woman, of whose kindness to you 
I can have no doubt.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And in all probability you will see 
your brother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and whatever may be his faults, or 
the faults of his wife,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when I consider whose son he is, I 
cannot bear to have you so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wholly estranged from each other.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Though with your usual anxiety 
for our happiness,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Elinor, &quot;you have been obviating 
every impediment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the present scheme which occurred 
to you, there is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">still one objection which, in my opinion, 
cannot be so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">easily removed.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's countenance sunk.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And what,&quot; said Mrs. Dashwood, 
&quot;is my dear prudent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor going to suggest?  What formidable 
obstacle is she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now to bring forward?  Do let me hear 
a word about the </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expense of it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My objection is this; though 
I think very well of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings's heart, she is not 
a woman whose society</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can afford us pleasure, or whose protection 
will give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">us consequence.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is very true,&quot;replied 
her mother, &quot;but of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her society, separately from that 
of other people,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you will scarcely have any thing at 
all, and you will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost always appear in public with 
Lady Middleton.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If Elinor is frightened away 
by her dislike of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings,&quot; said Marianne,&quot;at 
least it need not prevent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">MY accepting her invitation.  I have 
no such scruples,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I am sure I could put up with 
every unpleasantness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of that kind with very little effort.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not help smiling at this 
display of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indifference towards the manners of 
a person, to whom she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had often had difficulty in persuading 
Marianne to behave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with tolerable politeness; and resolved 
within herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that if her sister persisted in going, 
she would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">go likewise, as she did not think 
it proper that Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should be left to the sole guidance 
of her own judgment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or that Mrs. Jennings should be abandoned 
to the mercy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Marianne for all the comfort of 
her domestic hours.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To this determination she was the 
more easily reconciled,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, 
by Lucy's account,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not to be in town before February; 
and that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their visit, without any unreasonable 
abridgement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might be previously finished.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I will have you BOTH go,&quot; 
said Mrs. Dashwood;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;these objections are nonsensical.  
You will have much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pleasure in being in London, and especially 
in being together;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if Elinor would ever condescend 
to anticipate enjoyment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she would foresee it there from a 
variety of sources;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she would, perhaps, expect some from 
improving her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acquaintance with her sister-in-law's 
family.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor had often wished for an opportunity 
of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attempting to weaken her mother's 
dependence on the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attachment of Edward and herself, 
that the shock might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be less when the whole truth were 
revealed, and now</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on this attack, though almost hopeless 
of success,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she forced herself to begin her design 
by saying,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as calmly as she could, &quot;I like 
Edward Ferrars very much,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and shall always be glad to see him; 
but as to the rest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the family, it is a matter of perfect 
indifference</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to me, whether I am ever known to 
them or not.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment, 
and Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conjectured that she might as well 
have held her tongue.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After very little farther discourse, 
it was finally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">settled that the invitation should 
be fully accepted.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings received the information 
with a great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">deal of joy, and many assurances of 
kindness and care;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor was it a matter of pleasure merely 
to her.  Sir John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was delighted; for to a man, whose 
prevailing anxiety</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was the dread of being alone, the 
acquisition of two,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the number of inhabitants in London, 
was something.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Even Lady Middleton took the trouble 
of being delighted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which was putting herself rather out 
of her way;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as for the Miss Steeles, especially 
Lucy, they had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never been so happy in their lives 
as this intelligence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor submitted to the arrangement 
which counteracted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her wishes with less reluctance than 
she had expected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to feel.  With regard to herself, 
it was now a matter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of unconcern whether she went to town 
or not, and when</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased 
with the plan,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her sister exhilarated by it in 
look, voice, and manner,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">restored to all her usual animation, 
and elevated to more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than her usual gaiety, she could not 
be dissatisfied</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the cause, and would hardly allow 
herself to distrust</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the consequence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's joy was almost a degree 
beyond happiness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so great was the perturbation of her 
spirits and her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">impatience to be gone.  Her unwillingness 
to quit her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother was her only restorative to 
calmness; and at the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">moment of parting her grief on that 
score was excessive.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her mother's affliction was hardly 
less, and Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was the only one of the three, who 
seemed to consider</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the separation as any thing short 
of eternal.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their departure took place in the 
first week in January.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Middletons were to follow in about 
a week.  The Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Steeles kept their station at the 
park, and were to quit</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it only with the rest of the family.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 26</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not find herself in the 
carriage with Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and beginning a journey to London 
under her protection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as her guest, without wondering 
at her own situation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so short had their acquaintance with 
that lady been,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so wholly unsuited were they in age 
and disposition,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so many had been her objections 
against such a measure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only a few days before! But these 
objections had all,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with that happy ardour of youth which 
Marianne and her mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">equally shared, been overcome or overlooked; 
and Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in spite of every occasional doubt 
of Willoughby's constancy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not witness the rapture of delightful 
expectation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which filled the whole soul and beamed 
in the eyes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Marianne, without feeling how blank 
was her own prospect,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how cheerless her own state of mind 
in the comparison,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and how gladly she would engage in 
the solicitude of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's situation to have the same 
animating object</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in view, the same possibility of hope.  
A short, a very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">short time however must now decide 
what Willoughby's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intentions were; in all probability 
he was already in town.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's eagerness to be gone declared 
her dependence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on finding him there; and Elinor was 
resolved not only upon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gaining every new light as to his 
character which her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">own observation or the intelligence 
of others could give her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but likewise upon watching his behaviour 
to her sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with such zealous attention, as to 
ascertain what he was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and what he meant, before many meetings 
had taken place.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Should the result of her observations 
be unfavourable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was determined at all events to 
open the eyes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her sister; should it be otherwise, 
her exertions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would be of a different nature--she 
must then learn</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to avoid every selfish comparison, 
and banish every regret</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which might lessen her satisfaction 
in the happiness of Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were three days on their journey, 
and Marianne's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaviour as they travelled was a 
happy specimen of what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">future complaisance and companionableness 
to Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might be expected to be. She sat in 
silence almost all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the way, wrapt in her own meditations, 
and scarcely ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">voluntarily speaking, except when 
any object of picturesque</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beauty within their view drew from 
her an exclamation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of delight exclusively addressed to 
her sister.  To atone</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for this conduct therefore, Elinor 
took immediate possession</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the post of civility which she 
had assigned herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaved with the greatest attention 
to Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">talked with her, laughed with her, 
and listened to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whenever she could; and Mrs. Jennings 
on her side</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">treated them both with all possible 
kindness, was solicitous</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on every occasion for their ease and 
enjoyment, and only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disturbed that she could not make 
them choose their own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession 
of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">preferring salmon to cod, or boiled 
fowls to veal cutlets.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They reached town by three o'clock 
the third day, glad to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be released, after such a journey, 
from the confinement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a carriage, and ready to enjoy 
all the luxury of a good fire.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The house was handsome, and handsomely 
fitted up,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the young ladies were immediately 
put in possession</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a very comfortable apartment.  
It had formerly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been Charlotte's, and over the mantelpiece 
still hung</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a landscape in coloured silks of her 
performance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in proof of her having spent seven 
years at a great school</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in town to some effect.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As dinner was not to be ready in less 
than two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hours from their arrival, Elinor determined 
to employ</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the interval in writing to her mother, 
and sat down for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that purpose.  In a few moments Marianne 
did the same.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am writing home, Marianne,&quot; 
said Elinor; &quot;had not you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">better defer your letter for a day 
or two?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am NOT going to write to my 
mother,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">replied Marianne, hastily, and as 
if wishing to avoid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any farther inquiry.  Elinor said 
no more; it immediately</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">struck her that she must then be writing 
to Willoughby;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the conclusion which as instantly 
followed was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that, however mysteriously they might 
wish to conduct</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the affair, they must be engaged.  
This conviction,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though not entirely satisfactory, 
gave her pleasure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she continued her letter with 
greater alacrity.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's was finished in a very 
few minutes;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in length it could be no more than 
a note; it was then</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">folded up, sealed, and directed with 
eager rapidity.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor thought she could distinguish 
a large W in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the direction; and no sooner was it 
complete than Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ringing the bell, requested the footman 
who answered it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to get that letter conveyed for her 
to the two-penny post.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This decided the matter at once.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her spirits still continued very high; 
but there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was a flutter in them which prevented 
their giving much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pleasure to her sister, and this agitation 
increased as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the evening drew on.  She could scarcely 
eat any dinner,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and when they afterwards returned 
to the drawing room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed anxiously listening to the 
sound of every carriage.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was a great satisfaction to Elinor 
that Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by being much engaged in her own room, 
could see little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what was passing.  The tea things 
were brought in,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and already had Marianne been disappointed 
more than once</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by a rap at a neighbouring door, when 
a loud one was suddenly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">heard which could not be mistaken 
for one at any other house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor felt secure of its announcing 
Willoughby's approach,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne, starting up, moved towards 
the door.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Every thing was silent; this could 
not be borne many seconds;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she opened the door, advanced a few 
steps towards the stairs,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and after listening half a minute, 
returned into the room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in all the agitation which a conviction 
of having heard</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him would naturally produce; in the 
ecstasy of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feelings at that instant she could 
not help exclaiming,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, 
indeed it is!&quot; and seemed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost ready to throw herself into 
his arms, when Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon appeared.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was too great a shock to be borne 
with calmness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she immediately left the room.  
Elinor was disappointed too;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but at the same time her regard for 
Colonel Brandon ensured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his welcome with her; and she felt 
particularly hurt that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a man so partial to her sister should 
perceive that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">experienced nothing but grief and 
disappointment in seeing him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She instantly saw that it was not 
unnoticed by him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he even observed Marianne as 
she quitted the room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with such astonishment and concern, 
as hardly left him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the recollection of what civility 
demanded towards herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is your sister ill?&quot; said 
he.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor answered in some distress that 
she was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and then talked of head-aches, low 
spirits, and over fatigues;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and of every thing to which she could 
decently attribute</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister's behaviour.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He heard her with the most earnest 
attention,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but seeming to recollect himself, 
said no more on the subject,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and began directly to speak of his 
pleasure at seeing them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in London, making the usual inquiries 
about their journey,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the friends they had left behind.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In this calm kind of way, with very 
little interest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on either side, they continued to 
talk, both of them out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of spirits, and the thoughts of both 
engaged elsewhere.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor wished very much to ask whether 
Willoughby were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">then in town, but she was afraid of 
giving him pain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by any enquiry after his rival; and 
at length, by way</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of saying something, she asked if 
he had been in London</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ever since she had seen him last. &quot;Yes,&quot; 
he replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with some embarrassment, &quot;almost 
ever since; I have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">once or twice at Delaford for a few 
days, but it has never</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been in my power to return to Barton.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This, and the manner in which it was 
said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately brought back to her remembrance 
all the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">circumstances of his quitting that 
place, with the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">uneasiness and suspicions they had 
caused to Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she was fearful that her question 
had implied</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much more curiosity on the subject 
than she had ever felt.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings soon came in.  &quot;Oh! 
Colonel,&quot; said she,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with her usual noisy cheerfulness, 
&quot;I am monstrous glad</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see you--sorry I could not come 
before--beg your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pardon, but I have been forced to 
look about me a little,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and settle my matters; for it is a 
long while since I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been at home, and you know one 
has always a world</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of little odd things to do after one 
has been away for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any time; and then I have had Cartwright 
to settle with--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lord, I have been as busy as a bee 
ever since dinner!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But pray, Colonel, how came you to 
conjure out that I should</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be in town today?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I had the pleasure of hearing 
it at Mr. Palmer's,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where I have been dining.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, you did; well, and how do 
they all do at their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">house?  How does Charlotte do?  I 
warrant you she is a fine</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">size by this time.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, 
and I am commissioned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to tell you, that you will certainly 
see her to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ay, to be sure, I thought as 
much.  Well, Colonel,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have brought two young ladies with 
me, you see--that is,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you see but one of them now, but there 
is another somewhere.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Your friend, Miss Marianne, too--which 
you will not be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sorry to hear. I do not know what 
you and Mr. Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will do between you about her.  Ay, 
it is a fine thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be young and handsome.  Well! I 
was young once, but I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never was very handsome--worse luck 
for me.  However, I got</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a very good husband, and I don't know 
what the greatest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beauty can do more.  Ah! poor man! 
he has been dead</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">these eight years and better.  But 
Colonel, where have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you been to since we parted? And how 
does your business</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">go on? Come, come, let's have no secrets 
among friends.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He replied with his accustomary mildness 
to all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her inquiries, but without satisfying 
her in any.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor now began to make the tea, 
and Marianne was </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">obliged to appear again.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After her entrance, Colonel Brandon 
became</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more thoughtful and silent than he 
had been before,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail 
on him to stay long.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No other visitor appeared that evening, 
and the ladies</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were unanimous in agreeing to go early 
to bed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne rose the next morning with 
recovered spirits</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and happy looks.  The disappointment 
of the evening before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed forgotten in the expectation 
of what was to happen</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that day.  They had not long finished 
their breakfast before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer's barouche stopped at 
the door, and in a few</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">minutes she came laughing into the 
room: so delighted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see them all, that it was hard 
to say whether she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">received most pleasure from meeting 
her mother or the Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dashwoods again.  So surprised at 
their coming to town,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though it was what she had rather 
expected all along;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so angry at their accepting her mother's 
invitation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after having declined her own, though 
at the same time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she would never have forgiven them 
if they had not come!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mr. Palmer will be so happy 
to see you,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said she; &quot;What do you think 
he said when he heard</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of your coming with Mamma?  I forget 
what it was now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it was something so droll!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After an hour or two spent in what 
her mother called</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comfortable chat, or in other words, 
in every variety of inquiry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">concerning all their acquaintance 
on Mrs. Jennings's side,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in laughter without cause on Mrs. 
Palmer's, it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proposed by the latter that they should 
all accompany</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her to some shops where she had business 
that morning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor 
readily consented,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as having likewise some purchases 
to make themselves;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne, though declining it 
at first was induced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to go likewise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Wherever they went, she was evidently 
always on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the watch.  In Bond Street especially, 
where much of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their business lay, her eyes were 
in constant inquiry;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in whatever shop the party were 
engaged, her mind was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">equally abstracted from every thing 
actually before them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from all that interested and occupied 
the others.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Restless and dissatisfied every where, 
her sister could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never obtain her opinion of any article 
of purchase,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however it might equally concern them 
both: she received</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no pleasure from anything; was only 
impatient to be at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">home again, and could with difficulty 
govern her vexation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the tediousness of Mrs. Palmer, 
whose eye was caught</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by every thing pretty, expensive, 
or new; who was wild</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to buy all, could determine on none, 
and dawdled away her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time in rapture and indecision.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was late in the morning before 
they returned home;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and no sooner had they entered the 
house than Marianne flew</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">eagerly up stairs, and when Elinor 
followed, she found</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her turning from the table with a 
sorrowful countenance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which declared that no Willoughby 
had been there.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Has no letter been left here 
for me since we went out?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said she to the footman who then entered 
with the parcels.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was answered in the negative.  
&quot;Are you quite sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it?&quot; she replied.  &quot;Are 
you certain that no servant,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no porter has left any letter or note?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The man replied that none had.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How very odd!&quot; said she, 
in a low and disappointed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">voice, as she turned away to the window.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How odd, indeed!&quot; repeated 
Elinor within herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">regarding her sister with uneasiness.  
&quot;If she had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">known him to be in town she would 
not have written to him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she did; she would have written 
to Combe Magna;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if he is in town, how odd that 
he should neither</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">come nor write! Oh! my dear mother, 
you must be wrong</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in permitting an engagement between 
a daughter so young,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a man so little known, to be carried 
on in so doubtful,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so mysterious a manner! I long to 
inquire; and how will MY</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">interference be borne.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She determined, after some consideration, 
that if</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">appearances continued many days longer 
as unpleasant as they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now were, she would represent in the 
strongest manner</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her mother the necessity of some 
serious enquiry into the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affair.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies 
of Mrs. Jennings's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intimate acquaintance, whom she had 
met and invited</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the morning, dined with them. The 
former left them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">soon after tea to fulfill her evening 
engagements;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor was obliged to assist in 
making a whist table</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the others.  Marianne was of no 
use on these occasions,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she would never learn the game; 
but though her time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was therefore at her own disposal, 
the evening was by no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">means more productive of pleasure 
to her than to Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for it was spent in all the anxiety 
of expectation and the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pain of disappointment.  She sometimes 
endeavoured for a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">few minutes to read; but the book 
was soon thrown aside,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she returned to the more interesting 
employment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of walking backwards and forwards 
across the room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pausing for a moment whenever she 
came to the window,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected 
rap.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 27</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If this open weather holds much 
longer,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when they met at breakfast the following 
morning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Sir John will not like leaving 
Barton next week;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">'tis a sad thing for sportsmen to 
lose a day's pleasure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor souls!  I always pity them when 
they do; they seem</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to take it so much to heart.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is true,&quot; cried Marianne, 
in a cheerful voice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and walking to the window as she spoke, 
to examine the day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I had not thought of that. This 
weather will keep many</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sportsmen in the country.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was a lucky recollection, all her 
good spirits were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">restored by it.  &quot;It is charming 
weather for THEM indeed,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she continued, as she sat down to 
the breakfast table</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a happy countenance.  &quot;How 
much they must enjoy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it! But&quot; (with a little return 
of anxiety) &quot;it cannot</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be expected to last long. At this 
time of the year,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and after such a series of rain, we 
shall certainly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have very little more of it. Frosts 
will soon set in,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in all probability with severity.  
In another day</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or two perhaps; this extreme mildness 
can hardly last</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">longer--nay, perhaps it may freeze 
tonight!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;At any rate,&quot; said Elinor, 
wishing to prevent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings from seeing her sister's 
thoughts as clearly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she did, &quot;I dare say we shall 
have Sir John and Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton in town by the end of next 
week.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ay, my dear, I'll warrant you 
we do.  Mary always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has her own way.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And now,&quot; silently conjectured 
Elinor,&quot;she will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">write to Combe by this day's post.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But if she DID, the letter was written 
and sent away</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a privacy which eluded all her 
watchfulness to ascertain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the fact.  Whatever the truth of it 
might be, and far</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as Elinor was from feeling thorough 
contentment about it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yet while she saw Marianne in spirits, 
she could not be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very uncomfortable herself.  And Marianne 
was in spirits;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happy in the mildness of the weather, 
and still happier</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her expectation of a frost.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The morning was chiefly spent in leaving 
cards at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the houses of Mrs. Jennings's acquaintance 
to inform</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them of her being in town; and Marianne 
was all the time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">busy in observing the direction of 
the wind, watching the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">variations of the sky and imagining 
an alteration in the air.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Don't you find it colder than 
it was in the morning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor? There seems to me a very decided 
difference.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I can hardly keep my hands warm even 
in my muff. It was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not so yesterday, I think. The clouds 
seem parting too,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the sun will be out in a moment, and 
we shall have a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">clear afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was alternately diverted and 
pained;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Marianne persevered, and saw every 
night in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">brightness of the fire, and every 
morning in the appearance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms 
of approaching frost.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Miss Dashwoods had no greater 
reason to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's 
style of living, and set</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of acquaintance, than with her behaviour 
to themselves,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which was invariably kind. Every thing 
in her household</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">arrangements was conducted on the 
most liberal plan,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and excepting a few old city friends, 
whom, to Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton's regret, she had never 
dropped, she visited</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no one to whom an introduction could 
at all discompose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the feelings of her young companions.  
Pleased to find</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself more comfortably situated 
in that particular than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had expected, Elinor was very 
willing to compound</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the want of much real enjoyment 
from any of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">evening parties, which, whether at 
home or abroad,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">formed only for cards, could have 
little to amuse her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon, who had a general 
invitation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the house, was with them almost 
every day; he came</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor, 
who often derived</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more satisfaction from conversing 
with him than from any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other daily occurrence, but who saw 
at the same time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with much concern his continued regard 
for her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She feared it was a strengthening 
regard.  It grieved her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see the earnestness with which 
he often watched Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his spirits were certainly worse 
than when at Barton.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">About a week after their arrival, 
it became</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">certain that Willoughby was also arrived.  
His card</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was on the table when they came in 
from the morning's drive.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Good God!&quot; cried Marianne, 
&quot;he has been here while</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">we were out.&quot;  Elinor, rejoiced 
to be assured of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being in London, now ventured to say, 
&quot;Depend upon it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he will call again tomorrow.&quot; But 
Marianne seemed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hardly to hear her, and on Mrs. Jenning's 
entrance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">escaped with the precious card.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This event, while it raised the spirits 
of Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">restored to those of her sister all, 
and more than all,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their former agitation. From this 
moment her mind was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never quiet; the expectation of seeing 
him every hour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the day, made her unfit for any 
thing.  She insisted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on being left behind, the next morning, 
when the others</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">went out.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's thoughts were full of what 
might be passing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Berkeley Street during their absence; 
but a moment's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">glance at her sister when they returned 
was enough to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inform her, that Willoughby had paid 
no second visit there.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A note was just then brought in, and 
laid on the table,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;For me!&quot; cried Marianne, 
stepping hastily forward.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, ma'am, for my mistress.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Marianne, not convinced, took 
it instantly up.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; 
how provoking!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are expecting a letter, 
then?&quot; said Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unable to be longer silent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, a little--not much.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After a short pause.  &quot;You have 
no confidence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in me, Marianne.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Nay, Elinor, this reproach from 
YOU--you who have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">confidence in no one!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Me!&quot;returned Elinor in 
some confusion; &quot;indeed, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, I have nothing to tell.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Nor I,&quot; answered Marianne 
with energy,&quot;our situations</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">then are alike. We have neither of 
us any thing to tell;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you, because you do not communicate, 
and I, because </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I conceal nothing.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, distressed by this charge 
of reserve in herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which she was not at liberty to do 
away, knew not how,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">under such circumstances, to press 
for greater openness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the 
note being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">given her, she read it aloud.  It 
was from Lady Middleton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">announcing their arrival in Conduit 
Street the night before,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and requesting the company of her 
mother and cousins</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the following evening. Business on 
Sir John's part,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a violent cold on her own, prevented 
their calling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Berkeley Street.  The invitation 
was accepted;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but when the hour of appointment drew 
near, necessary as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was in common civility to Mrs. 
Jennings, that they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should both attend her on such a visit, 
Elinor had some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">difficulty in persuading her sister 
to go, for still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had seen nothing of Willoughby; 
and therefore was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not more indisposed for amusement 
abroad, than unwilling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to run the risk of his calling again 
in her absence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor found, when the evening was 
over,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that disposition is not materially 
altered by a change</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of abode, for although scarcely settled 
in town,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John had contrived to collect 
around him, nearly twenty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">young people, and to amuse them with 
a ball.  This was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an affair, however, of which Lady 
Middleton did not approve.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In the country, an unpremeditated 
dance was very allowable;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but in London, where the reputation 
of elegance was more </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">important and less easily attained, 
it was risking too much </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the gratification of a few girls, 
to have it known that </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton had given a small dance 
of eight or nine couple, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with two violins, and a mere side-board 
collation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; 
from the former,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whom they had not seen before since 
their arrival in town,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as he was careful to avoid the appearance 
of any attention</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to his mother-in-law, and therefore 
never came near her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they received no mark of recognition 
on their entrance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He looked at them slightly, without 
seeming to know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who they were, and merely nodded to 
Mrs. Jennings from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the other side of the room. Marianne 
gave one glance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">round the apartment as she entered: 
it was enough--HE</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not there--and she sat down, equally 
ill-disposed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to receive or communicate pleasure.  
After they had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assembled about an hour, Mr. Palmer 
sauntered towards</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the Miss Dashwoods to express his 
surprise on seeing them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in town, though Colonel Brandon had 
been first informed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their arrival at his house, and 
he had himself said</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">something very droll on hearing that 
they were to come.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I thought you were both in Devonshire,&quot; 
said he.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did you?&quot; replied Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;When do you go back again?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not know.&quot; And thus 
ended their discourse.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Never had Marianne been so unwilling 
to dance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her life, as she was that evening, 
and never so much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fatigued by the exercise.  She complained 
of it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as they returned to Berkeley Street.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Aye, aye,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, 
&quot;we know the reason</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all that very well; if a certain 
person who shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be nameless, had been there, you would 
not have been a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bit tired: and to say the truth it 
was not very pretty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of him not to give you the meeting 
when he was invited.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Invited!&quot;cried Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;So my daughter Middleton told 
me, for it seems Sir</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">John met him somewhere in the street 
this morning.&quot;  </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne said no more, but looked 
exceedingly hurt.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Impatient in this situation to be 
doing something</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that might lead to her sister's relief, 
Elinor resolved</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to write the next morning to her mother, 
and hoped</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by awakening her fears for the health 
of Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to procure those inquiries which had 
been so long delayed;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she was still more eagerly bent 
on this measure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by perceiving after breakfast on the 
morrow, that Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was again writing to Willoughby, for 
she could not suppose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it to be to any other person.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">About the middle of the day, Mrs. 
Jennings went out by</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself on business, and Elinor began 
her letter directly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while Marianne, too restless for employment, 
too anxious</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for conversation, walked from one 
window to the other,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or sat down by the fire in melancholy 
meditation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was very earnest in her application 
to her mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">relating all that had passed, her 
suspicions of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby's inconstancy, urging her 
by every plea</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of duty and affection to demand from 
Marianne an account</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her real situation with respect 
to him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her letter was scarcely finished, 
when a rap</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">foretold a visitor, and Colonel Brandon 
was announced.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, who had seen him from the 
window, and who hated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">company of any kind, left the room 
before he entered it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He looked more than usually grave, 
and though expressing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood 
alone, as if he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had somewhat in particular to tell 
her, sat for some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time without saying a word.  Elinor, 
persuaded that he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had some communication to make in 
which her sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was concerned, impatiently expected 
its opening.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was not the first time of her feeling 
the same kind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of conviction; for, more than once 
before, beginning with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the observation of &quot;your sister 
looks unwell to-day,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or &quot;your sister seems out of 
spirits,&quot; he had appeared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the point, either of disclosing, 
or of inquiring,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">something particular about her.  After 
a pause of several</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">minutes, their silence was broken, 
by his asking her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a voice of some agitation, when 
he was to congratulate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her on the acquisition of a brother?  
Elinor was not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">prepared for such a question, and 
having no answer ready,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was obliged to adopt the simple and 
common expedient,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of asking what he meant?  He tried 
to smile as he replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;your sister's engagement to 
Mr. Willoughby is very generally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">known.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It cannot be generally known,&quot; 
returned Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;for her own family do not know 
it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He looked surprised and said, &quot;I 
beg your pardon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am afraid my inquiry has been impertinent; 
but I had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">supposed any secrecy intended, as 
they openly correspond,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and their marriage is universally 
talked of.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How can that be? By whom can 
you have heard</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it mentioned?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;By many--by some of whom you 
know nothing, by others</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with whom you are most intimate, Mrs. 
Jennings, Mrs. Palmer,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the Middletons.  But still I might 
not have believed it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for where the mind is perhaps rather 
unwilling to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be convinced, it will always find 
something to support</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its doubts, if I had not, when the 
servant let me in today,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">accidentally seen a letter in his 
hand, directed to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Willoughby in your sister's writing.  
I came to inquire,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but I was convinced before I could 
ask the question.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Is every thing finally settled?  Is 
it impossible to-? </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I have no right, and I could have 
no chance of succeeding.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Excuse me, Miss Dashwood.  I believe 
I have been wrong</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in saying so much, but I hardly know 
what to do, and on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your prudence I have the strongest 
dependence. Tell me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that it is all absolutely resolved 
on, that any attempt,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that in short concealment, if concealment 
be possible,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is all that remains.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">These words, which conveyed to Elinor 
a direct avowal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his love for her sister, affected 
her very much.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was not immediately able to say 
anything, and even</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when her spirits were recovered, she 
debated for a short</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time, on the answer it would be most 
proper to give.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The real state of things between Willoughby 
and her sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was so little known to herself, that 
in endeavouring</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to explain it, she might be as liable 
to say too much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as too little.  Yet as she was convinced 
that Marianne's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection for Willoughby, could leave 
no hope of Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon's success, whatever the event 
of that affection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might be, and at the same time wished 
to shield her conduct</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from censure, she thought it most 
prudent and kind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after some consideration, to say more 
than she really knew</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or believed.  She acknowledged, therefore, 
that though</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had never been informed by themselves 
of the terms</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on which they stood with each other, 
of their mutual</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection she had no doubt, and of 
their correspondence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was not astonished to hear.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He listened to her with silent attention, 
and on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her ceasing to speak, rose directly 
from his seat,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and after saying in a voice of emotion, 
&quot;to your sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I wish all imaginable happiness; to 
Willoughby that he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may endeavour to deserve her,&quot;--took 
leave, and went away.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor derived no comfortable feelings 
from this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conversation, to lessen the uneasiness 
of her mind on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other points; she was left, on the 
contrary, with a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon's 
unhappiness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and was prevented even from wishing 
it removed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by her anxiety for the very event 
that must confirm it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 28</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nothing occurred during the next three 
or four days,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make Elinor regret what she had 
done, in applying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her mother; for Willoughby neither 
came nor wrote.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were engaged about the end of 
that time to attend</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton to a party, from which 
Mrs. Jennings was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">kept away by the indisposition of 
her youngest daughter;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and for this party, Marianne, wholly 
dispirited,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">careless of her appearance, and seeming 
equally indifferent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whether she went or staid, prepared, 
without one look</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of hope or one expression of pleasure.  
She sat by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">drawing-room fire after tea, till 
the moment of Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton's arrival, without once 
stirring from her seat,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or altering her attitude, lost in 
her own thoughts,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and insensible of her sister's presence; 
and when at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">last they were told that Lady Middleton 
waited for them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the door, she started as if she 
had forgotten that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any one was expected.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They arrived in due time at the place 
of destination,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as soon as the string of carriages 
before them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would allow, alighted, ascended the 
stairs, heard their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">names announced from one landing-place 
to another in an</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">audible voice, and entered a room 
splendidly lit up,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite full of company, and insufferably 
hot.  When they had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">paid their tribute of politeness by 
curtsying to the lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the house, they were permitted 
to mingle in the crowd,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and take their share of the heat and 
inconvenience, to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which their arrival must necessarily 
add.  After some time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spent in saying little or doing less, 
Lady Middleton sat</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">down to Cassino, and as Marianne was 
not in spirits for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">moving about, she and Elinor luckily 
succeeding to chairs,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">placed themselves at no great distance 
from the table.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They had not remained in this manner 
long, before Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perceived Willoughby, standing within 
a few yards</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of them, in earnest conversation with 
a very fashionable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">looking young woman. She soon caught 
his eye, and he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately bowed, but without attempting 
to speak to her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or to approach Marianne, though he 
could not but see her;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and then continued his discourse with 
the same lady.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne, 
to see whether</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it could be unobserved by her.  At 
that moment she first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perceived him, and her whole countenance 
glowing with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sudden delight, she would have moved 
towards him instantly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had not her sister caught hold of 
her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; she exclaimed, 
&quot;he is there--he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is there--Oh! why does he not look 
at me? why cannot</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I speak to him?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Pray, pray be composed,&quot; 
cried Elinor, &quot;and do</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not betray what you feel to every 
body present.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Perhaps he has not observed you yet.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This however was more than she could 
believe herself;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to be composed at such a moment 
was not only beyond</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the reach of Marianne, it was beyond 
her wish. She sat</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in an agony of impatience which affected 
every feature.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At last he turned round again, and 
regarded them both;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she started up, and pronouncing his 
name in a tone</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of affection, held out her hand to 
him.  He approached,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and addressing himself rather to Elinor 
than Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as if wishing to avoid her eye, and 
determined not to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">observe her attitude, inquired in 
a hurried manner after </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood, and asked how long 
they had been in town.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was robbed of all presence 
of mind by such an address,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and was unable to say a word. But 
the feelings of her sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were instantly expressed.  Her face 
was crimsoned over,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she exclaimed, in a voice of the 
greatest emotion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Good God! Willoughby, what is 
the meaning of this?  </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Have you not received my letters?  
Will you not shake </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hands with me?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He could not then avoid it, but her 
touch seemed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">painful to him, and he held her hand 
only for a moment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">During all this time he was evidently 
struggling for composure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor watched his countenance and 
saw its expression</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">becoming more tranquil.  After a moment's 
pause, he spoke</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with calmness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I did myself the honour of calling 
in Berkeley</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Street last Tuesday, and very much 
regretted that I was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not fortunate enough to find yourselves 
and Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at home.  My card was not lost, I 
hope.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But have you not received my 
notes?&quot; cried Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the wildest anxiety. &quot;Here 
is some mistake I am</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sure--some dreadful mistake.  What 
can be the meaning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it?  Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven's 
sake tell me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what is the matter?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He made no reply; his complexion changed 
and all his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">embarrassment returned; but as if, 
on catching the eye</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the young lady with whom he had 
been previously talking,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he felt the necessity of instant exertion, 
he recovered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">himself again, and after saying, &quot;Yes, 
I had the pleasure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of receiving the information of your 
arrival in town,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which you were so good as to send 
me,&quot;turned hastily away</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a slight bow and joined his friend.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, 
and unable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to stand, sunk into her chair, and 
Elinor, expecting every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">moment to see her faint, tried to 
screen her from the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">observation of others, while reviving 
her with lavender water.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Go to him, Elinor,&quot; she 
cried, as soon as she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could speak, &quot;and force him to 
come to me.  Tell him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I must see him again--must speak to 
him instantly.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I cannot rest--I shall not have a 
moment's peace till this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is explained--some dreadful misapprehension 
or other.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Oh go to him this moment.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How can that be done? No, my 
dearest Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you must wait. This is not the place 
for explanations.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Wait only till tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With difficulty however could she 
prevent her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from following him herself; and to 
persuade her to check</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her agitation, to wait, at least, 
with the appearance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of composure, till she might speak 
to him with more privacy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and more effect, was impossible; for 
Marianne continued</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">incessantly to give way in a low voice 
to the misery</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her feelings, by exclamations of 
wretchedness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby 
quit the room by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">door towards the staircase, and telling 
Marianne that he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was gone, urged the impossibility 
of speaking to him again</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that evening, as a fresh argument 
for her to be calm.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She instantly begged her sister would 
entreat Lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Middleton to take them home, as she 
was too miserable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to stay a minute longer.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton, though in the middle 
of a rubber,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on being informed that Marianne was 
unwell, was too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">polite to object for a moment to her 
wish of going away,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and making over her cards to a friend, 
they departed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon the carriage could be found. 
 Scarcely a word</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was spoken during their return to 
Berkeley Street.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was in a silent agony, too 
much oppressed even</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was 
luckily not come home,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they could go directly to their own 
room, where hartshorn</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">restored her a little to herself.  
She was soon undressed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in bed, and as she seemed desirous 
of being alone,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister then left her, and while 
she waited the return</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure enough 
for thinking over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the past.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">That some kind of engagement had subsisted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">between Willoughby and Marianne she 
could not doubt,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that Willoughby was weary of it, 
seemed equally clear;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for however Marianne might still feed 
her own wishes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">SHE could not attribute such behaviour 
to mistake</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or misapprehension of any kind.  Nothing 
but a thorough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">change of sentiment could account 
for it.  Her indignation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would have been still stronger than 
it was, had she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not witnessed that embarrassment which 
seemed to speak</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a consciousness of his own misconduct, 
and prevented</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her from believing him so unprincipled 
as to have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sporting with the affections of her 
sister from the first,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without any design that would bear 
investigation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Absence might have weakened his regard, 
and convenience</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might have determined him to overcome 
it, but that such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a regard had formerly existed she 
could not bring herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to doubt.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As for Marianne, on the pangs which 
so unhappy a meeting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must already have given her, and on 
those still more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">severe which might await her in its 
probable consequence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could not reflect without the 
deepest concern.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her own situation gained in the comparison; 
for while she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could ESTEEM Edward as much as ever, 
however they might be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">divided in future, her mind might 
be always supported.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But every circumstance that could 
embitter such an evil</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed uniting to heighten the misery 
of Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a final separation from Willoughby--in 
an immediate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and irreconcilable rupture with him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 29</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Before the house-maid had lit their 
fire the next day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or the sun gained any power over a 
cold, gloomy morning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in January, Marianne, only half dressed, 
was kneeling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against one of the window-seats for 
the sake of all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the little light she could command 
from it, and writing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as fast as a continual flow of tears 
would permit her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In this situation, Elinor, roused 
from sleep by her agitation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sobs, first perceived her; and 
after observing her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a few moments with silent anxiety, 
said, in a tone</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the most considerate gentleness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Marianne, may I ask-?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, Elinor,&quot; she replied, 
&quot;ask nothing; you will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">soon know all.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The sort of desperate calmness with 
which this was said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lasted no longer than while she spoke, 
and was immediately</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">followed by a return of the same excessive 
affliction.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was some minutes before she could 
go on with her letter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the frequent bursts of grief which 
still obliged her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at intervals, to withhold her pen, 
were proofs enough of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feeling how more than probable it 
was that she was writing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the last time to Willoughby.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive 
attention</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her power; and she would have tried 
to sooth and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tranquilize her still more, had not 
Marianne entreated her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with all the eagerness of the most 
nervous irritability,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not to speak to her for the world.  
In such circumstances, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was better for both that they should 
not be long together;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the restless state of Marianne's 
mind not only prevented</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her from remaining in the room a moment 
after she was dressed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but requiring at once solitude and 
continual change of place,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made her wander about the house till 
breakfast time, avoiding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the sight of every body. </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At breakfast she neither ate, nor 
attempted to eat </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any thing; and Elinor's attention 
was then all employed, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not in urging her, not in pitying 
her, nor in appearing </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to regard her, but in endeavouring 
to engage Mrs. Jenning's </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">notice entirely to herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As this was a favourite meal with 
Mrs. Jennings, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it lasted a considerable time, and 
they were just setting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">themselves, after it, round the common 
working table, when a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">letter was delivered to Marianne, 
which she eagerly caught</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the servant, and, turning of 
a death-like paleness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">instantly ran out of the room.  Elinor, 
who saw as plainly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by this, as if she had seen the direction, 
that it must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">come from Willoughby, felt immediately 
such a sickness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at heart as made her hardly able to 
hold up her head,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sat in such a general tremour 
as made her fear it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">impossible to escape Mrs. Jenning's 
notice.  That good lady,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, saw only that Marianne had 
received a letter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from Willoughby, which appeared to 
her a very good joke,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and which she treated accordingly, 
by hoping, with a laugh,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she would find it to her liking.  
Of Elinor's distress,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was too busily employed in measuring 
lengths of worsted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her rug, to see any thing at all; 
and calmly continuing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her talk, as soon as Marianne disappeared, 
she said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon my word, I never saw a 
young woman so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">desperately in love in my life!  MY 
girls were nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her, and yet they used to be foolish 
enough; but as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Miss Marianne, she is quite an 
altered creature.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I hope, from the bottom of my heart, 
he won't keep her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">waiting much longer, for it is quite 
grievous to see her </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">look so ill and forlorn.  Pray, when 
are they to be married?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, though never less disposed 
to speak than at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that moment, obliged herself to answer 
such an attack</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as this, and, therefore, trying to 
smile, replied, &quot;And have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you really, Ma'am, talked yourself 
into a persuasion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of my sister's being engaged to Mr. 
Willoughby?  I thought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it had been only a joke, but so serious 
a question seems</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to imply more; and I must beg, therefore, 
that you will not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">deceive yourself any longer. I do 
assure you that nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would surprise me more than to hear 
of their being going </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be married.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;For shame, for shame, Miss Dashwood! 
how can you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">talk so?  Don't we all know that it 
must be a match, that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they were over head and ears in love 
with each other from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the first moment they met?  Did not 
I see them together</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Devonshire every day, and all day 
long; and did not I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know that your sister came to town 
with me on purpose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to buy wedding clothes?  Come, come, 
this won't do.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Because you are so sly about it yourself, 
you think nobody</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">else has any senses; but it is no 
such thing, I can tell you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for it has been known all over town 
this ever so long.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I tell every body of it and so does 
Charlotte.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed, Ma'am,&quot; said Elinor, 
very seriously,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;you are mistaken.  Indeed, you 
are doing a very unkind thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in spreading the report, and you will 
find that you have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though you will not believe me now.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings laughed again, but Elinor 
had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spirits to say more, and eager at 
all events to know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what Willoughby had written, hurried 
away to their room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where, on opening the door, she saw 
Marianne stretched on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the bed, almost choked by grief, one 
letter in her hand,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and two or three others laying by 
her.  Elinor drew near,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but without saying a word; and seating 
herself on the bed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">took her hand, kissed her affectionately 
several times,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and then gave way to a burst of tears, 
which at first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was scarcely less violent than Marianne's. 
The latter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though unable to speak, seemed to 
feel all the tenderness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of this behaviour, and after some 
time thus spent in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">joint affliction, she put all the 
letters into Elinor's hands;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and then covering her face with her 
handkerchief,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost screamed with agony. Elinor, 
who knew that such grief,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shocking as it was to witness it, 
must have its course,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">watched by her till this excess of 
suffering had somewhat</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spent itself, and then turning eagerly 
to Willoughby's letter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">read as follows:</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                              &quot;Bond 
Street, January.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;MY DEAR MADAM,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;I have just had the honour 
of receiving your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     letter, for which I beg to return 
my sincere</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    acknowledgments.  I am much concerned 
to find there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     was anything in my behaviour 
last night that did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     not meet your approbation; and 
though I am quite at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     a loss to discover in what point 
I could be so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     unfortunate as to offend you, 
I entreat your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    forgiveness of what I can assure 
you to have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     perfectly unintentional.  I shall 
never reflect on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     my former acquaintance with your 
family in Devonshire</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     without the most grateful pleasure, 
and flatter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    myself it will not be broken by 
any mistake or</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     misapprehension of my actions.  
My esteem for your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     whole family is very sincere; 
but if I have been so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     unfortunate as to give rise to 
a belief of more than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    I felt, or meant to express, I 
shall reproach myself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     for not having been more guarded 
in my professions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     of that esteem.  That I should 
ever have meant more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     you will allow to be impossible, 
when you understand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    that my affections have been long 
engaged elsewhere,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     and it will not be many weeks, 
I believe, before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     this engagement is fulfilled.  
It is with great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     regret that I obey your commands 
in returning the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     letters with which I have been 
honoured from you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    and the lock of hair, which you 
so obligingly bestowed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     on me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;I am, dear Madam,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">               &quot;Your most obedient</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                    &quot;humble servant,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                                        
&quot;JOHN WILLOUGHBY.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With what indignation such a letter 
as this must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be read by Miss Dashwood, may be imagined.  
Though aware,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before she began it, that it must 
bring a confession</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his inconstancy, and confirm their 
separation for ever,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was not aware that such language 
could be suffered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to announce it; nor could she have 
supposed Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">capable of departing so far from the 
appearance of every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">honourable and delicate feeling--so 
far from the common</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">decorum of a gentleman, as to send 
a letter so impudently</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cruel: a letter which, instead of 
bringing with his desire</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a release any professions of regret, 
acknowledged no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">breach of faith, denied all peculiar 
affection whatever--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a letter of which every line was an 
insult, and which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proclaimed its writer to be deep in 
hardened villainy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She paused over it for some time with 
indignant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">astonishment; then read it again and 
again; but every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perusal only served to increase her 
abhorrence of the man,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so bitter were her feelings against 
him, that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dared not trust herself to speak, 
lest she might wound</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne still deeper by treating 
their disengagement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not as a loss to her of any possible 
good but as an</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">escape from the worst and most irremediable 
of all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">evils, a connection, for life, with 
an unprincipled man,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as a deliverance the most real, a 
blessing the most important.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In her earnest meditations on the 
contents of the letter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the depravity of that mind which 
could dictate it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and probably, on the very different 
mind of a very different</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">person, who had no other connection 
whatever with the affair</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than what her heart gave him with 
every thing that passed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor forgot the immediate distress 
of her sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">forgot that she had three letters 
on her lap yet unread,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so entirely forgot how long she 
had been in the room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that when on hearing a carriage drive 
up to the door,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she went to the window to see who 
could be coming so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unreasonably early, she was all astonishment 
to perceive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings's chariot, which she 
knew had not been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ordered till one. Determined not to 
quit Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though hopeless of contributing, at 
present, to her ease,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she hurried away to excuse herself 
from attending</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings, on account of her sister 
being indisposed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings, with a thoroughly good-humoured 
concern</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for its cause, admitted the excuse 
most readily, and Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after seeing her safe off, returned 
to Marianne, whom she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">found attempting to rise from the 
bed, and whom she reached</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">just in time to prevent her from falling 
on the floor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">faint and giddy from a long want of 
proper rest and food;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for it was many days since she had 
any appetite, and many</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nights since she had really slept; 
and now, when her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mind was no longer supported by the 
fever of suspense,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the consequence of all this was felt 
in an aching head,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a weakened stomach, and a general 
nervous faintness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A glass of wine, which Elinor procured 
for her directly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made her more comfortable, and she 
was at last able to express</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some sense of her kindness, by saying, 
</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Poor Elinor! how unhappy I make 
you!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I only wish,&quot;replied her 
sister, &quot;there were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any thing I COULD do, which might 
be of comfort to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This, as every thing else would have 
been,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was too much for Marianne, who could 
only exclaim,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the anguish of her heart, &quot;Oh! 
Elinor, I am miserable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indeed,&quot;before her voice was 
entirely lost in sobs.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could no longer witness this 
torrent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of unresisted grief in silence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Exert yourself, dear Marianne,&quot; 
she cried,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;if you would not kill yourself 
and all who love you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Think of your mother; think of her 
misery while YOU suffer:</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her sake you must exert yourself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I cannot, I cannot,&quot; cried 
Marianne; &quot;leave me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">leave me, if I distress you; leave 
me, hate me, forget me!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but do not torture me so.  Oh! how 
easy for those,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who have no sorrow of their own to 
talk of exertion! Happy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happy Elinor, YOU cannot have an idea 
of what I suffer.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do you call ME happy, Marianne?  
Ah! if you knew!--And</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can you believe me to be so, while 
I see you so wretched!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Forgive me, forgive me,&quot; 
throwing her arms round</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister's neck; &quot;I know you 
feel for me; I know what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a heart you have; but yet you are--you 
must be happy;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward loves you--what, oh what, can 
do away such happiness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as that?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Many, many circumstances,&quot;said 
Elinor, solemnly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, no, no,&quot; cried Marianne 
wildly, &quot;he loves you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and only you. You CAN have no grief.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I can have no pleasure while 
I see you in this state.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And you will never see me otherwise.  
Mine is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a misery which nothing can do away.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You must not talk so, Marianne.  
Have you no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comforts? no friends?  Is your loss 
such as leaves</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no opening for consolation? Much as 
you suffer now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think of what you would have suffered 
if the discovery</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his character had been delayed 
to a later period--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if your engagement had been carried 
on for months and months,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as it might have been, before he chose 
to put an end to it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Every additional day of unhappy confidence, 
on your side,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would have made the blow more dreadful.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Engagement!&quot; cried Marianne, 
&quot;there has been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no engagement.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No engagement!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, he is not so unworthy as 
you believe him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He has broken no faith with me.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But he told you that he loved 
you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes--no--never absolutely.  
It was every day implied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but never professedly declared. Sometimes 
I thought it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been--but it never was.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yet you wrote to him?&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes--could that be wrong after 
all that had passed?--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I cannot talk.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor said no more, and turning again 
to the three</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">letters which now raised a much stronger 
curiosity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than before, directly ran over the 
contents of all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The first, which was what her sister 
had sent him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on their arrival in town, was to this 
effect.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                         Berkeley 
Street, January.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;How surprised you will 
be, Willoughby, on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     receiving this; and I think you 
will feel something</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    more than surprise, when you know 
that I am in town.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     An opportunity of coming hither, 
though with Mrs.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     Jennings, was a temptation we 
could not resist.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    I wish you may receive this in 
time to come here</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     to-night, but I will not depend 
on it.  At any rate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     I shall expect you to-morrow. 
For the present, adieu.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                                             
&quot;M.D.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her second note, which had been written 
on the morning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after the dance at the Middletons', 
was in these words:--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;I cannot express my disappointment 
in having</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     missed you the day before yesterday, 
nor my astonishment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     at not having received any answer 
to a note which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    I sent you above a week ago.  
I have been expecting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     to hear from you, and still more 
to see you, every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     hour of the day.  Pray call again 
as soon as possible,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    and explain the reason of my having 
expected this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     in vain. You had better come 
earlier another time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     because we are generally out 
by one.  We were last</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     night at Lady Middleton's, where 
there was a dance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     I have been told that you were 
asked to be of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     party.  But could it be so?  
You must be very much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     altered indeed since we parted, 
if that could be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     the case, and you not there.  
But I will not suppose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     this possible, and I hope very 
soon to receive your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     personal assurance of its being 
otherwise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                                            &quot;M.D.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The contents of her last note to him 
were these:--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    &quot;What am I to imagine, Willoughby, 
by your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     behaviour last night?  Again 
I demand an explanation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     of it. I was prepared to meet 
you with the pleasure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     which our separation naturally 
produced, with the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     familiarity which our intimacy 
at Barton appeared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     to me to justify.  I was repulsed 
indeed! I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     passed a wretched night in endeavouring 
to excuse</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     a conduct which can scarcely 
be called less than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     insulting; but though I have 
not yet been able to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     form any reasonable apology for 
your behaviour,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     I am perfectly ready to hear 
your justification of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    it.  You have perhaps been misinformed, 
or purposely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    deceived, in something concerning 
me, which may have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     lowered me in your opinion.  
Tell me what it is,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     explain the grounds on which 
you acted, and I shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     be satisfied, in being able to 
satisfy you.  It</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     would grieve me indeed to be 
obliged to think ill</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     of you; but if I am to do it, 
if I am to learn that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    you are not what we have hitherto 
believed you, that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     your regard for us all was insincere, 
that your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     behaviour to me was intended 
only to deceive, let</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    it be told as soon as possible. My 
feelings are at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    present in a state of dreadful 
indecision; I wish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     to acquit you, but certainty 
on either side will be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     ease to what I now suffer.  If 
your sentiments are</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     no longer what they were, you 
will return my notes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     and the lock of my hair which 
is in your possession.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                                            &quot;M.D.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">That such letters, so full of affection 
and confidence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could have been so answered, Elinor, 
for Willoughby's sake,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would have been unwilling to believe.  
But her condemnation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of him did not blind her to the impropriety 
of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">having been written at all; and she 
was silently grieving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">over the imprudence which had hazarded 
such unsolicited</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proofs of tenderness, not warranted 
by anything preceding,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and most severely condemned by the 
event, when Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perceiving that she had finished the 
letters, observed to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her that they contained nothing but 
what any one would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have written in the same situation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I felt myself,&quot; she added,&quot;to 
be as solemnly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">engaged to him, as if the strictest 
legal covenant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had bound us to each other.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I can believe it,&quot; said 
Elinor; &quot;but unfortunately</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he did not feel the same.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He DID feel the same, Elinor--for 
weeks and weeks he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">felt it.  I know he did.  Whatever 
may have changed him now, (and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing but the blackest art employed 
against me can have done</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it), I was once as dear to him as 
my own soul could wish.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This lock of hair, which now he can 
so readily give up,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was begged of me with the most earnest 
supplication.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Had you seen his look, his manner, 
had you heard his voice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at that moment!  Have you forgot the 
last evening of our</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being together at Barton?  The morning 
that we parted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too!  When he told me that it might 
be many weeks before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">we met again--his distress--can I 
ever forget his distress?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">For a moment or two she could say 
no more;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but when this emotion had passed away, 
she added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a firmer tone, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Elinor, I have been cruelly 
used; but not by Willoughby.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Dearest Marianne, who but himself?  
By whom can he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been instigated?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;By all the world, rather than 
by his own heart.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I could rather believe every creature 
of my acquaintance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">leagued together to ruin me in his 
opinion, than believe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his nature capable of such cruelty.  
This woman of whom he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">writes--whoever she be--or any one, 
in short, but your own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dear self, mama, and Edward, may have 
been so barbarous</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to bely me.  Beyond you three, is 
there a creature </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world whom I would not rather 
suspect of evil</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than Willoughby, whose heart I know 
so well?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor would not contend, and only 
replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Whoever may have been so detestably 
your enemy, let them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be cheated of their malignant triumph, 
my dear sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by seeing how nobly the consciousness 
of your own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">innocence and good intentions supports 
your spirits.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is a reasonable and laudable pride 
which resists</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such malevolence.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, no,&quot; cried Marianne, 
&quot;misery such as mine has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no pride.  I care not who knows that 
I am wretched.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The triumph of seeing me so may be 
open to all the world.  </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, Elinor, they who suffer little 
may be proud and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">independent as they like--may resist 
insult, or return</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mortification--but I cannot.  I must 
feel--I must be </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wretched--and they are welcome to 
enjoy the consciousness </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it that can.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But for my mother's sake and 
mine--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I would do more than for my 
own.  But to appear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happy when I am so miserable--Oh! 
who can require it?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Again they were both silent.  Elinor 
was employed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in walking thoughtfully from the fire 
to the window,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the window to the fire, without 
knowing that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">received warmth from one, or discerning 
objects through</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the other; and Marianne, seated at 
the foot of the bed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with her head leaning against one 
of its posts,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">again took up Willoughby's letter, 
and, after shuddering</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">over every sentence, exclaimed--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is too much! Oh, Willoughby, 
Willoughby, could this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be yours!  Cruel, cruel--nothing can 
acquit you. Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing can. Whatever he might have 
heard against me--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ought he not to have suspended his 
belief? ought he not to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have told me of it, to have given 
me the power of clearing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself? 'The lock of hair, (repeating 
it from the letter,)</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which you so obligingly bestowed on 
me'--That is unpardonable.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby, where was your heart when 
you wrote those words?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Oh, barbarously insolent!--Elinor, 
can he be justified?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, Marianne, in no possible 
way.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And yet this woman--who knows 
what her art may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been?--how long it may have been 
premeditated,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and how deeply contrived by her!--Who 
is she?--Who can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she be?--Whom did I ever hear him 
talk of as young and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attractive among his female acquaintance?--Oh! 
no one,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no one--he talked to me only of myself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Another pause ensued; Marianne was 
greatly agitated,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it ended thus.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Elinor, I must go home.  I must 
go and comfort mama.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Can not we be gone to-morrow?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To-morrow, Marianne!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, why should I stay here? 
I came only for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby's sake--and now who cares 
for me? Who regards me?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It would be impossible to go 
to-morrow. We owe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings much more than civility; 
and civility of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the commonest kind must prevent such 
a hasty removal as that.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well then, another day or two, 
perhaps; but I cannot</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stay here long, I cannot stay to endure 
the questions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and remarks of all these people.  
The Middletons and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Palmers--how am I to bear their pity?  
The pity of such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a woman as Lady Middleton!  Oh, what 
would HE say to that!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor advised her to lie down again, 
and for a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">moment she did so; but no attitude 
could give her ease;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in restless pain of mind and body 
she moved from one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">posture to another, till growing more 
and more hysterical,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister could with difficulty keep 
her on the bed at all,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and for some time was fearful of being 
constrained to call</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for assistance.  Some lavender drops, 
however, which she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was at length persuaded to take, were 
of use; and from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that time till Mrs. Jennings returned, 
she continued</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the bed quiet and motionless.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 30</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings came immediately to 
their room on her return,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and without waiting to have her request 
of admittance answered,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opened the door and walked in with 
a look of real concern.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How do you do my dear?&quot;--said 
she in a voice of great </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">compassion to Marianne, who turned 
away her face without </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attempting to answer.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How is she, Miss Dashwood?--Poor 
thing! she looks very bad.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No wonder.  Ay, it is but too true.  
He is to be married</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very soon--a good-for-nothing fellow!  
I have no patience</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with him.  Mrs. Taylor told me of 
it half an hour ago,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she was told it by a particular 
friend of Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Grey herself, else I am sure I should 
not have believed it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I was almost ready to sink as 
it was. Well, said I,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all I can say is, that if this be 
true, he has used</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a young lady of my acquaintance abominably 
ill, and I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wish with all my soul his wife may 
plague his heart out.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And so I shall always say, my dear, 
you may depend on it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have no notion of men's going on 
in this way; and if ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I meet him again, I will give him 
such a dressing as he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has not had this many a day. But there 
is one comfort,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my dear Miss Marianne; he is not the 
only young man</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world worth having; and with 
your pretty face</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you will never want admirers.  Well, 
poor thing!  I won't</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disturb her any longer, for she had 
better have her cry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out at once and have done with.  The 
Parrys and Sandersons</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">luckily are coming tonight you know, 
and that will amuse her.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She then went away, walking on tiptoe 
out of the room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as if she supposed her young friend's 
affliction could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be increased by noise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, to the surprise of her sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">determined on dining with them.  Elinor 
even advised</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her against it.  But &quot;no, she 
would go down; she could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bear it very well, and the bustle 
about her would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be less.&quot;  Elinor, pleased to 
have her governed for a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">moment by such a motive, though believing 
it hardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possible that she could sit out the 
dinner, said no more;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and adjusting her dress for her as 
well as she could,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while Marianne still remained on the 
bed, was ready</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to assist her into the dining room 
as soon as they were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">summoned to it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When there, though looking most wretchedly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she ate more and was calmer than her 
sister had expected.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Had she tried to speak, or had she 
been conscious of half</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings's well-meant but ill-judged 
attentions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her, this calmness could not have 
been maintained;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but not a syllable escaped her lips; 
and the abstraction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her thoughts preserved her in ignorance 
of every thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that was passing before her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings's 
kindness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though its effusions were often distressing, 
and sometimes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost ridiculous, made her those 
acknowledgments,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and returned her those civilities, 
which her sister could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not make or return for herself.  Their 
good friend saw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Marianne was unhappy, and felt 
that every thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was due to her which might make her 
at all less so.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She treated her therefore, with all 
the indulgent fondness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a parent towards a favourite child 
on the last day of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its holidays.  Marianne was to have 
the best place by the fire,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was to be tempted to eat by every 
delicacy in the house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to be amused by the relation of 
all the news of the day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Had not Elinor, in the sad countenance 
of her sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seen a check to all mirth, she could 
have been entertained</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Mrs. Jennings's endeavours to cure 
a disappointment in love,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, 
and a good fire.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As soon, however, as the consciousness 
of all this was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">forced by continual repetition on 
Marianne, she could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stay no longer.  With a hasty exclamation 
of Misery,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a sign to her sister not to follow 
her, she directly got</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">up and hurried out of the room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Poor soul!&quot; cried Mrs. 
Jennings, as soon as she was gone,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;how it grieves me to see her!  
And I declare if she is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not gone away without finishing her 
wine!  And the dried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cherries too!  Lord! nothing seems 
to do her any good.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure if I knew of any thing she 
would like, I would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">send all over the town for it. Well, 
it is the oddest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thing to me, that a man should use 
such a pretty girl</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so ill!  But when there is plenty 
of money on one side,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and next to none on the other, Lord 
bless you! they care</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no more about such things!--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The lady then--Miss Grey I think 
you called her--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is very rich?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Fifty thousand pounds, my dear.  
Did you ever see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her? a smart, stylish girl they say, 
but not handsome.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I remember her aunt very well, Biddy 
Henshawe; she married</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a very wealthy man.  But the family 
are all rich together.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fifty thousand pounds! and by all 
accounts, it won't come</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before it's wanted; for they say he 
is all to pieces.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No wonder! dashing about with his 
curricle and hunters!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Well, it don't signify talking; but 
when a young man,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be who he will, comes and makes love 
to a pretty girl,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and promises marriage, he has no business 
to fly off</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from his word only because he grows 
poor, and a richer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">girl is ready to have him.  Why don't 
he, in such a case,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sell his horses, let his house, turn 
off his servants,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and make a thorough reform at once? 
I warrant you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Marianne would have been ready 
to wait till matters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">came round.  But that won't do now-a-days; 
nothing in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">way of pleasure can ever be given 
up by the young men of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this age.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do you know what kind of a girl 
Miss Grey is? </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Is she said to be amiable?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I never heard any harm of her; 
indeed I hardly ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">heard her mentioned; except that Mrs. 
Taylor did say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this morning, that one day Miss Walker 
hinted to her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison 
would not be sorry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to have Miss Grey married, for she 
and Mrs. Ellison could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never agree.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And who are the Ellisons?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Her guardians, my dear.  But 
now she is of age</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and may choose for herself; and a 
pretty choice she has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made!--What now,&quot; after pausing 
a moment--&quot;your poor sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is gone to her own room, I suppose, 
to moan by herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Is there nothing one can get to comfort 
her?  Poor dear,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it seems quite cruel to let her be 
alone.  Well, by-and-by we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shall have a few friends, and that 
will amuse her a little.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What shall we play at?  She hates 
whist I know; but is there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no round game she cares for?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Dear ma'am, this kindness is 
quite unnecessary.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, I dare say, will not leave 
her room again</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this evening. I shall persuade her 
if I can to go</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">early to bed, for I am sure she wants 
rest.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Aye, I believe that will be 
best for her.  Let her name</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her own supper, and go to bed.  Lord! 
no wonder she has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been looking so bad and so cast down 
this last week or two,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for this matter I suppose has been 
hanging over her head as </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">long as that.  And so the letter that 
came today finished it! </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor soul!  I am sure if I had had 
a notion of it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I would not have joked her about it 
for all my money.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But then you know, how should I guess 
such a thing?  I made </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sure of its being nothing but a common 
love letter, and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know young people like to be laughed 
at about them.  Lord! </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how concerned Sir John and my daughters 
will be when they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hear it!  If I had my senses about 
me I might have called</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Conduit Street in my way home, 
and told them of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I shall see them tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It would be unnecessary I am 
sure, for you to caution</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer and Sir John against ever 
naming Mr. Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or making the slightest allusion to 
what has passed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before my sister.  Their own good-nature 
must point out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to them the real cruelty of appearing 
to know any thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about it when she is present; and 
the less that may ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be said to myself on the subject, 
the more my feelings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will be spared, as you my dear madam 
will easily believe.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed.  
It must be terrible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for you to hear it talked of; and 
as for your sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure I would not mention a word 
about it to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the world.  You saw I did not 
all dinner time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, 
for they are</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all very thoughtful and considerate; 
especially if I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">give them a hint, as I certainly will.  
For my part,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I think the less that is said about 
such things, the better,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the sooner 'tis blown over and forgot.  
And what does</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">talking ever do you know?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;In this affair it can only do 
harm; more so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perhaps than in many cases of a similar 
kind, for it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has been attended by circumstances 
which, for the sake</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of every one concerned in it, make 
it unfit to become</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the public conversation.  I must do 
THIS justice to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Willoughby--he has broken no positive 
engagement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with my sister.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Law, my dear! Don't pretend 
to defend him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No positive engagement indeed! after 
taking her all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">over Allenham House, and fixing on 
the very rooms they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were to live in hereafter!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, for her sister's sake, could 
not press the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subject farther, and she hoped it 
was not required of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Willoughby's; since, though Marianne 
might lose much,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he could gain very little by the enforcement 
of the real truth.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After a short silence on both sides, 
Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with all her natural hilarity, burst 
forth again.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, my dear, 'tis a true saying 
about an ill-wind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for it will be all the better for 
Colonel Brandon.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He will have her at last; aye, that 
he will.  Mind me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now, if they an't married by Mid-summer.  
Lord! how he'll</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">chuckle over this news!  I hope he 
will come tonight.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It will be all to one a better match 
for your sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Two thousand a year without debt or 
drawback--except</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the little love-child, indeed; aye, 
I had forgot her;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but she may be 'prenticed out at a 
small cost, and then</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what does it signify? Delaford is 
a nice place, I can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tell you; exactly what I call a nice 
old fashioned place,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">full of comforts and conveniences; 
quite shut in with great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">garden walls that are covered with 
the best fruit-trees</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the country; and such a mulberry 
tree in one corner!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff 
the only time we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were there!  Then, there is a dove-cote, 
some delightful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stew-ponds, and a very pretty canal; 
and every thing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in short, that one could wish for; 
and, moreover, it is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">close to the church, and only a quarter 
of a mile from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the turnpike-road, so 'tis never dull, 
for if you only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">go and sit up in an old yew arbour 
behind the house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you may see all the carriages that 
pass along.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Oh! 'tis a nice place!  A butcher 
hard by in the village,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the parsonage-house within a stone's 
throw.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To my fancy, a thousand times prettier 
than Barton Park,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where they are forced to send three 
miles for their meat,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and have not a neighbour nearer than 
your mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel 
as soon as I can.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One shoulder of mutton, you know, 
drives another down.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If we CAN but put Willoughby out of 
her head!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ay, if we can do THAT, Ma'am,&quot; 
said Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;we shall do very well with or 
without Colonel Brandon.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And then rising, she went away to 
join Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whom she found, as she expected, in 
her own room, leaning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in silent misery, over the small remains 
of a fire,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which, till Elinor's entrance, had 
been her only light.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You had better leave me,&quot; 
was all the notice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that her sister received from her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I will leave you,&quot; said 
Elinor, &quot;if you will go</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to bed.&quot; But this, from the momentary 
perverseness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of impatient suffering, she at first 
refused to do.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her sister's earnest, though gentle 
persuasion, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">soon softened her to compliance, and 
Elinor saw her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lay her aching head on the pillow, 
and as she hoped,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a way to get some quiet rest before 
she left her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In the drawing-room, whither she then 
repaired,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was soon joined by Mrs. Jennings, 
with a wine-glass,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">full of something, in her hand.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My dear,&quot; said she, entering, 
&quot;I have just recollected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that I have some of the finest old 
Constantia wine in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">house that ever was tasted, so I have 
brought a glass of it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for your sister.  My poor husband! 
how fond he was of it!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Whenever he had a touch of his old 
colicky gout, he said</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it did him more good than any thing 
else in the world.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Do take it to your sister.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Dear Ma'am,&quot; replied Elinor, 
smiling at the difference</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the complaints for which it was 
recommended,&quot;how good</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you are!  But I have just left Marianne 
in bed, and, I hope,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost asleep; and as I think nothing 
will be of so much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">service to her as rest, if you will 
give me leave,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I will drink the wine myself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that 
she had not been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">five minutes earlier, was satisfied 
with the compromise;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor, as she swallowed the chief 
of it, reflected,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that though its effects on a colicky 
gout were, at present,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of little importance to her, its healing 
powers,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on a disappointed heart might be as 
reasonably tried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on herself as on her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon came in while the 
party were at tea,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and by his manner of looking round 
the room for Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor immediately fancied that he 
neither expected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor wished to see her there, and, 
in short, that he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was already aware of what occasioned 
her absence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings was not struck by the 
same thought;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for soon after his entrance, she walked 
across the room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the tea-table where Elinor presided, 
and whispered--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The Colonel looks as grave as 
ever you see.  He knows</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing of it; do tell him, my dear.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He shortly afterwards drew a chair 
close to her's,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and, with a look which perfectly assured 
her of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good information, inquired after her 
sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Marianne is not well,&quot; 
said she.  &quot;She has been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indisposed all day, and we have persuaded 
her to go to bed.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps, then,&quot; he hesitatingly 
replied, &quot;what I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">heard this morning may be--there may 
be more truth in it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than I could believe possible at first.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What did you hear?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That a gentleman, whom I had 
reason to think--in short,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that a man, whom I KNEW to be engaged--but 
how shall I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tell you? If you know it already, 
as surely you must,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I may be spared.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You mean,&quot; answered Elinor, 
with forced calmness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mr. Willoughby's marriage with 
Miss Grey.  Yes, we DO</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know it all.  This seems to have been 
a day of general</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">elucidation, for this very morning 
first unfolded it to us.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable!  Where 
did you hear it?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;In a stationer's shop in Pall 
Mall, where I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had business.  Two ladies were waiting 
for their carriage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and one of them was giving the other 
an account of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intended match, in a voice so little 
attempting concealment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that it was impossible for me not 
to hear all.  The name</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently 
repeated,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">first caught my attention; and what 
followed was a positive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assertion that every thing was now 
finally settled</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">respecting his marriage with Miss 
Grey--it was no longer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be a secret--it would take place 
even within a few weeks,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with many particulars of preparations 
and other matters.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One thing, especially, I remember, 
because it served</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to identify the man still more:--as 
soon as the ceremony</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was over, they were to go to Combe 
Magna, his seat</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Somersetshire.  My astonishment!--but 
it would be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">impossible to describe what I felt.  
The communicative</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lady I learnt, on inquiry, for I stayed 
in the shop</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, 
and that, as I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been since informed, is the name 
of Miss Grey's guardian.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is.  But have you likewise 
heard that Miss Grey</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has fifty thousand pounds? In that, 
if in any thing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">we may find an explanation.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It may be so; but Willoughby 
is capable--at least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I think&quot;--he stopped a moment; 
then added in a voice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which seemed to distrust itself, &quot;And 
your sister--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how did she--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Her sufferings have been very 
severe.  I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only to hope that they may be proportionately 
short.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It has been, it is a most cruel affliction.  
Till yesterday,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I believe, she never doubted his regard; 
and even now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perhaps--but I am almost convinced 
that he never was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">really attached to her.  He has been 
very deceitful! and,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in some points, there seems a hardness 
of heart about him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ah!&quot;said Colonel Brandon, 
&quot;there is, indeed! But</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your sister does not--I think you 
said so--she does</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not consider quite as you do?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You know her disposition, and 
may believe how eagerly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she would still justify him if she 
could.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He made no answer; and soon afterwards, 
by the removal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the tea-things, and the arrangement 
of the card parties,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the subject was necessarily dropped.  
Mrs. Jennings, who had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">watched them with pleasure while they 
were talking, and who</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expected to see the effect of Miss 
Dashwood's communication,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in such an instantaneous gaiety on 
Colonel Brandon's side,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as might have become a man in the 
bloom of youth, of hope</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and happiness, saw him, with amazement, 
remain the whole</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">evening more serious and thoughtful 
than usual.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER XXXI</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">From a night of more sleep than she 
had expected,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne awoke the next morning to 
the same consciousness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of misery in which she had closed 
her eyes.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor encouraged her as much as possible 
to talk</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what she felt; and before breakfast 
was ready, they had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gone through the subject again and 
again; and with the same</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">steady conviction and affectionate 
counsel on Elinor's side,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the same impetuous feelings and varying 
opinions on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's, as before.  Sometimes 
she could believe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby to be as unfortunate and 
as innocent as herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and at others, lost every consolation 
in the impossibility</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of acquitting him.  At one moment 
she was absolutely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indifferent to the observation of 
all the world, at another</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she would seclude herself from it 
for ever, and at a third</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could resist it with energy.  In one 
thing, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was uniform, when it came to the 
point, in avoiding,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where it was possible, the presence 
of Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in a determined silence when obliged 
to endure it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her heart was hardened against the 
belief of Mrs. Jennings's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entering into her sorrows with any 
compassion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, no, no, it cannot be,&quot; 
she cried;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;she cannot feel.  Her kindness 
is not sympathy;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her good-nature is not tenderness.  
All that she wants</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is gossip, and she only likes me now 
because I supply it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor had not needed this to be assured 
of the injustice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to which her sister was often led 
in her opinion of others,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the irritable refinement of her 
own mind, and the too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great importance placed by her on 
the delicacies of a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">strong sensibility, and the graces 
of a polished manner.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Like half the rest of the world, if 
more than half there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be that are clever and good, Marianne, 
with excellent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">abilities and an excellent disposition, 
was neither</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reasonable nor candid.  She expected 
from other people</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the same opinions and feelings as 
her own, and she judged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their motives by the immediate 
effect of their actions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on herself.  Thus a circumstance occurred, 
while the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sisters were together in their own 
room after breakfast,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which sunk the heart of Mrs. Jennings 
still lower</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her estimation; because, through 
her own weakness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it chanced to prove a source of fresh 
pain to herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though Mrs. Jennings was governed 
in it by an impulse</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the utmost goodwill.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With a letter in her outstretched 
hand, and countenance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gaily smiling, from the persuasion 
of bringing comfort,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she entered their room, saying,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Now, my dear, I bring you something 
that I am sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will do you good.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne heard enough.  In one moment 
her imagination</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">placed before her a letter from Willoughby, 
full of tenderness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and contrition, explanatory of all 
that had passed, satisfactory,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">convincing; and instantly followed 
by Willoughby himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rushing eagerly into the room to inforce, 
at her feet,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the eloquence of his eyes, the 
assurances of his letter.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The work of one moment was destroyed 
by the next.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The hand writing of her mother, never 
till then unwelcome,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was before her; and, in the acuteness 
of the disappointment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which followed such an ecstasy of 
more than hope,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she felt as if, till that instant, 
she had never suffered.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, 
within</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her reach in her moments of happiest 
eloquence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could have expressed; and now she 
could reproach her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only by the tears which streamed from 
her eyes with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">passionate violence--a reproach, however, 
so entirely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lost on its object, that after many 
expressions of pity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she withdrew, still referring her 
to the letter of comfort.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But the letter, when she was calm 
enough to read it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">brought little comfort.  Willoughby 
filled every page.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her mother, still confident of their 
engagement, and relying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as warmly as ever on his constancy, 
had only been roused</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Elinor's application, to intreat 
from Marianne greater</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">openness towards them both; and this, 
with such tenderness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">towards her, such affection for Willoughby, 
and such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a conviction of their future happiness 
in each other,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she wept with agony through the 
whole of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">All her impatience to be at home again 
now returned;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her mother was dearer to her than 
ever; dearer through</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the very excess of her mistaken confidence 
in Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she was wildly urgent to be gone.  
Elinor, unable herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to determine whether it were better 
for Marianne to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in London or at Barton, offered no 
counsel of her own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">except of patience till their mother's 
wishes could be known;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and at length she obtained her sister's 
consent to wait</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for that knowledge.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than 
usual; for she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not be easy till the Middletons 
and Palmers were able</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to grieve as much as herself; and 
positively refusing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's offered attendance, went 
out alone for the rest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the morning.  Elinor, with a very 
heavy heart, aware of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the pain she was going to communicate, 
and perceiving,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Marianne's letter, how ill she 
had succeeded in laying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any foundation for it, then sat down 
to write her mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an account of what had passed, and 
entreat her directions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the future; while Marianne, who 
came into the drawing-room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on Mrs. Jennings's going away, remained 
fixed at the table</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement 
of her pen,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">grieving over her for the hardship 
of such a task,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and grieving still more fondly over 
its effect on her mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In this manner they had continued 
about a quarter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of an hour, when Marianne, whose nerves 
could not then</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bear any sudden noise, was startled 
by a rap at the door.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Who can this be?&quot; cried 
Elinor. &quot;So early too! I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thought we HAD been safe.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne moved to the window--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is Colonel Brandon!&quot; 
said she, with vexation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We are never safe from HIM.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He will not come in, as Mrs. 
Jennings is from home.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I will not trust to THAT,&quot; 
retreating to her own room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;A man who has nothing to do 
with his own time has no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conscience in his intrusion on that 
of others.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The event proved her conjecture right, 
though it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was founded on injustice and error; 
for Colonel Brandon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">DID come in; and Elinor, who was convinced 
that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">solicitude for Marianne brought him 
thither, and who saw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">THAT solicitude in his disturbed and 
melancholy look,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in his anxious though brief inquiry 
after her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not forgive her sister for esteeming 
him so lightly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond 
Street,&quot; said he,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after the first salutation, &quot;and 
she encouraged me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to come on; and I was the more easily 
encouraged,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because I thought it probable that 
I might find you alone,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which I was very desirous of doing.  
My object--my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wish--my sole wish in desiring it--I 
hope, I believe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it is--is to be a means of giving 
comfort;--no, I must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not say comfort--not present comfort--but 
conviction,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lasting conviction to your sister's 
mind.  My regard for her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for yourself, for your mother--will 
you allow me to prove it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by relating some circumstances which 
nothing but a VERY</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sincere regard--nothing but an earnest 
desire of being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">useful--I think I am justified--though 
where so many hours</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been spent in convincing myself 
that I am right,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is there not some reason to fear I 
may be wrong?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He stopped.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I understand you,&quot; said 
Elinor.  &quot;You have something</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to tell me of Mr. Willoughby, that 
will open his character</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">farther.  Your telling it will be 
the greatest act of friendship</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that can be shewn Marianne. MY gratitude 
will be insured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately by any information tending 
to that end, and HERS</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be gained by it in time.  Pray, 
pray let me hear it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You shall; and, to be brief, 
when I quitted Barton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">last October,--but this will give 
you no idea--I must go</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">farther back.  You will find me a 
very awkward narrator,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where 
to begin.  A short</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">account of myself, I believe, will 
be necessary, and it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">SHALL be a short one.  On such a subject,&quot; 
sighing heavily,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;can I have little temptation 
to be diffuse.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He stopt a moment for recollection, 
and then,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with another sigh, went on.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You have probably entirely forgotten 
a conversation--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">(it is not to be supposed that it 
could make any impression</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on you)--a conversation between us 
one evening at Barton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Park--it was the evening of a dance--in 
which I alluded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to a lady I had once known, as resembling, 
in some measure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your sister Marianne.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed,&quot;answered Elinor, 
&quot;I have NOT forgotten it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He looked pleased by this remembrance, 
and added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If I am not deceived by the 
uncertainty, the partiality</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of tender recollection, there is a 
very strong resemblance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">between them, as well in mind as person.  
The same warmth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of heart, the same eagerness of fancy 
and spirits.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This lady was one of my nearest relations, 
an orphan from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her infancy, and under the guardianship 
of my father.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Our ages were nearly the same, and 
from our earliest years</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">we were playfellows and friends.  
I cannot remember the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time when I did not love Eliza; and 
my affection for her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, 
judging from my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">present forlorn and cheerless gravity, 
you might think me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">incapable of having ever felt.  Her's, 
for me, was, I believe,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fervent as the attachment of your 
sister to Mr. Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it was, though from a different 
cause, no less unfortunate.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At seventeen she was lost to me for 
ever.  She was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">married--married against her inclination 
to my brother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her fortune was large, and our family 
estate much encumbered.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And this, I fear, is all that can 
be said for the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conduct of one, who was at once her 
uncle and guardian.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My brother did not deserve her; he 
did not even love her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had hoped that her regard for me 
would support her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">under any difficulty, and for some 
time it did; but at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">last the misery of her situation, 
for she experienced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great unkindness, overcame all her 
resolution, and though</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had promised me that nothing--but 
how blindly I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">relate!  I have never told you how 
this was brought on.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">We were within a few hours of eloping 
together for Scotland.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The treachery, or the folly, of my 
cousin's maid betrayed us.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I was banished to the house of a relation 
far distant,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she was allowed no liberty, no 
society, no amusement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">till my father's point was gained.  
I had depended on her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fortitude too far, and the blow was 
a severe one--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but had her marriage been happy, so 
young as I then was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a few months must have reconciled 
me to it, or at least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I should not have now to lament it. This 
however</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not the case. My brother had no 
regard for her;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his pleasures were not what they ought 
to have been,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and from the first he treated her 
unkindly.  The consequence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of this, upon a mind so young, so 
lively, so inexperienced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as Mrs. Brandon's, was but too natural.  
She resigned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself at first to all the misery 
of her situation;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and happy had it been if she had not 
lived to overcome those</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">regrets which the remembrance of me 
occasioned.  But can we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wonder that, with such a husband to 
provoke inconstancy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and without a friend to advise or 
restrain her (for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my father lived only a few months 
after their marriage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I was with my regiment in the 
East Indies) she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should fall?  Had I remained in England, 
perhaps--but I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">meant to promote the happiness of 
both by removing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from her for years, and for that purpose 
had procured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my exchange.  The shock which her 
marriage had given me,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he continued, in a voice of great 
agitation, &quot;was of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">trifling weight--was nothing to what 
I felt when I heard,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about two years afterwards, of her 
divorce.  It was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">THAT which threw this gloom,--even 
now the recollection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what I suffered--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He could say no more, and rising hastily 
walked for a few</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">minutes about the room. Elinor, affected 
by his relation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and still more by his distress, could 
not speak.  He saw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her concern, and coming to her, took 
her hand, pressed it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and kissed it with grateful respect.  
A few minutes more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of silent exertion enabled him to 
proceed with composure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It was nearly three years after 
this unhappy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">period before I returned to England.  
My first care,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when I DID arrive, was of course to 
seek for her;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the search was as fruitless as 
it was melancholy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I could not trace her beyond her first 
seducer, and there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was every reason to fear that she 
had removed from him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only to sink deeper in a life of sin.  
Her legal allowance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not adequate to her fortune, nor 
sufficient for her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comfortable maintenance, and I learnt 
from my brother that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the power of receiving it had been 
made over some months</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before to another person.  He imagined, 
and calmly could he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">imagine it, that her extravagance, 
and consequent distress,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had obliged her to dispose of it for 
some immediate relief.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At last, however, and after I had 
been six months in England,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I DID find her.  Regard for a former 
servant of my own,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who had since fallen into misfortune, 
carried me to visit</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him in a spunging-house, where he 
was confined for debt;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and there, the same house, under a 
similar confinement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was my unfortunate sister. So altered--so 
faded--worn</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">down by acute suffering of every kind! 
hardly could I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">believe the melancholy and sickly 
figure before me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, 
healthful girl,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on whom I had once doted.  What I 
endured in so beholding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her--but I have no right to wound 
your feelings by attempting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to describe it--I have pained you 
too much already.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">That she was, to all appearance, in 
the last stage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a consumption, was--yes, in such 
a situation it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my greatest comfort.  Life could do 
nothing for her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beyond giving time for a better preparation 
for death;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that was given.  I saw her placed 
in comfortable lodgings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and under proper attendants; I visited 
her every day</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">during the rest of her short life: 
I was with her in her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">last moments.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Again he stopped to recover himself; 
and Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spoke her feelings in an exclamation 
of tender concern,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the fate of his unfortunate friend.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your sister, I hope, cannot 
be offended,&quot; said he,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;by the resemblance I have fancied 
between her and my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">poor disgraced relation. Their fates, 
their fortunes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cannot be the same; and had the natural 
sweet</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disposition of the one been guarded 
by a firmer mind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or a happier marriage, she might have 
been all that you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will live to see the other be.  But 
to what does all this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lead?  I seem to have been distressing 
you for nothing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Ah! Miss Dashwood--a subject such 
as this--untouched</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for fourteen years--it is dangerous 
to handle it at all!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I WILL be more collected--more concise.  
She left to my care</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her only child, a little girl, the 
offspring of her first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">guilty connection, who was then about 
three years old.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She loved the child, and had always 
kept it with her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was a valued, a precious trust 
to me; and gladly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would I have discharged it in the 
strictest sense,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by watching over her education myself, 
had the nature</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of our situations allowed it; but 
I had no family, no home;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and my little Eliza was therefore 
placed at school.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I saw her there whenever I could, 
and after the death of my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">brother, (which happened about five 
years ago, and which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">left to me the possession of the family 
property,) she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">visited me at Delaford.  I called 
her a distant relation;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but I am well aware that I have in 
general been suspected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a much nearer connection with her.  
It is now three</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">years ago (she had just reached her 
fourteenth year,)</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that I removed her from school, to 
place her under the care</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a very respectable woman, residing 
in Dorsetshire,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who had the charge of four or five 
other girls of about</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the same time of life; and for two 
years I had every reason</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be pleased with her situation.  
But last February,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost a twelvemonth back, she suddenly 
disappeared.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had allowed her, (imprudently, as 
it has since turned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out,) at her earnest desire, to go 
to Bath with one of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her young friends, who was attending 
her father there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for his health.  I knew him to be 
a very good sort of man,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I thought well of his daughter--better 
than she deserved,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for, with a most obstinate and ill-judged 
secrecy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she would tell nothing, would give 
no clue, though she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">certainly knew all.  He, her father, 
a well-meaning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but not a quick-sighted man, could 
really, I believe,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">give no information; for he had been 
generally confined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the house, while the girls were 
ranging over the town</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and making what acquaintance they 
chose; and he tried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to convince me, as thoroughly as he 
was convinced himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned 
in the business.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In short, I could learn nothing but 
that she was gone;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all the rest, for eight long months, 
was left to conjecture.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What I thought, what I feared, may 
be imagined; and what I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suffered too.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Good heavens!&quot; cried Elinor, 
&quot;could it be--could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby!&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The first news that reached 
me of her,&quot; he continued,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;came in a letter from herself, 
last October.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was forwarded to me from Delaford, 
and I received it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the very morning of our intended 
party to Whitwell;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and this was the reason of my leaving 
Barton so suddenly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which I am sure must at the time have 
appeared strange</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to every body, and which I believe 
gave offence to some.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Little did Mr. Willoughby imagine, 
I suppose, when his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">looks censured me for incivility in 
breaking up the party,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that I was called away to the relief 
of one whom he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had made poor and miserable; but HAD 
he known it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what would it have availed?  Would 
he have been less</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gay or less happy in the smiles of 
your sister? No,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he had already done that, which no 
man who CAN feel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for another would do.  He had left 
the girl whose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">youth and innocence he had seduced, 
in a situation of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the utmost distress, with no creditable 
home, no help,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no friends, ignorant of his address!  
He had left her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">promising to return; he neither returned, 
nor wrote,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor relieved her.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;This is beyond every thing!&quot; 
exclaimed Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;His character is now before 
you; expensive, dissipated,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and worse than both.  Knowing all 
this, as I have now</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">known it many weeks, guess what I 
must have felt on seeing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your sister as fond of him as ever, 
and on being assured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she was to marry him: guess what 
I must have felt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for all your sakes. When I came to 
you last week and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">found you alone, I came determined 
to know the truth;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though irresolute what to do when 
it WAS known.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My behaviour must have seemed strange 
to you then;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but now you will comprehend it.  To 
suffer you all to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so deceived; to see your sister--but 
what could I do?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had no hope of interfering with 
success; and sometimes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I thought your sister's influence 
might yet reclaim him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But now, after such dishonorable usage, 
who can tell what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were his designs on her.  Whatever 
they may have been,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, she may now, and hereafter 
doubtless WILL</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">turn with gratitude towards her own 
condition, when she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">compares it with that of my poor Eliza, 
when she considers</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the wretched and hopeless situation 
of this poor girl,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and pictures her to herself, with 
an affection for him so strong,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">still as strong as her own, and with 
a mind tormented</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by self-reproach, which must attend 
her through life.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Surely this comparison must have its 
use with her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She will feel her own sufferings to 
be nothing. They</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proceed from no misconduct, and can 
bring no disgrace.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On the contrary, every friend must 
be made still more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her friend by them.  Concern for her 
unhappiness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and respect for her fortitude under 
it, must strengthen</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every attachment.  Use your own discretion, 
however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in communicating to her what I have 
told you.  You must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know best what will be its effect; 
but had I not seriously,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and from my heart believed it might 
be of service,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might lessen her regrets, I would 
not have suffered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself to trouble you with this account 
of my family</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">afflictions, with a recital which 
may seem to have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intended to raise myself at the expense 
of others.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's thanks followed this speech 
with grateful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">earnestness; attended too with the 
assurance of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expecting material advantage to Marianne, 
from the </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">communication of what had passed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have been more pained,&quot; 
said she, &quot;by her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">endeavors to acquit him than by all 
the rest; for it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">irritates her mind more than the most 
perfect conviction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his unworthiness can do.  Now, 
though at first she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will suffer much, I am sure she will 
soon become easier.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Have you,&quot; she continued, after 
a short silence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;ever seen Mr. Willoughby since 
you left him at Barton?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes,&quot; he replied gravely,&quot;once 
I have.  One meeting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was unavoidable.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, startled by his manner, looked 
at him anxiously,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">saying,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What? have you met him to--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I could meet him no other way.  
Eliza had confessed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to me, though most reluctantly, the 
name of her lover;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and when he returned to town, which 
was within a fortnight</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after myself, we met by appointment, 
he to defend,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I to punish his conduct. We returned 
unwounded,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the meeting, therefore, never 
got abroad.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity 
of this;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but to a man and a soldier she presumed 
not to censure it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Such,&quot;said Colonel Brandon, 
after a pause,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;has been the unhappy resemblance 
between the fate of mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and daughter! and so imperfectly have 
I discharged my trust!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is she still in town?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No; as soon as she recovered 
from her lying-in,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I found her near her delivery, 
I removed her and her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">child into the country, and there 
she remains.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Recollecting, soon afterwards, that 
he was probably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dividing Elinor from her sister, he 
put an end to his visit,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">receiving from her again the same 
grateful acknowledgments,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and leaving her full of compassion 
and esteem for him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 32</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When the particulars of this conversation 
were repeated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Miss Dashwood to her sister, as 
they very soon were,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the effect on her was not entirely 
such as the former</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had hoped to see.  Not that Marianne 
appeared to distrust</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the truth of any part of it, for she 
listened to it all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the most steady and submissive 
attention, made neither</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">objection nor remark, attempted no 
vindication of Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and seemed to shew by her tears that 
she felt it to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be impossible.  But though this behaviour 
assured Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that the conviction of this guilt 
WAS carried home to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her mind, though she saw with satisfaction 
the effect of it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her no longer avoiding Colonel 
Brandon when he called,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her speaking to him, even voluntarily 
speaking,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a kind of compassionate respect, 
and though she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">saw her spirits less violently irritated 
than before,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she did not see her less wretched.  
Her mind did become </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">settled, but it was settled in a gloomy 
dejection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She felt the loss of Willoughby's 
character yet more heavily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than she had felt the loss of his 
heart; his seduction and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">desertion of Miss Williams, the misery 
of that poor girl,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the doubt of what his designs 
might ONCE have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on herself, preyed altogether so much 
on her spirits,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she could not bring herself to 
speak of what she felt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even to Elinor; and, brooding over 
her sorrows in silence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gave more pain to her sister than 
could have been communicated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the most open and most frequent 
confession of them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To give the feelings or the language 
of Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on receiving and answering Elinor's 
letter would be only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to give a repetition of what her daughters 
had already felt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and said; of a disappointment hardly 
less painful than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's, and an indignation even 
greater than Elinor's.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Long letters from her, quickly succeeding 
each other,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">arrived to tell all that she suffered 
and thought;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to express her anxious solicitude 
for Marianne, and entreat</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she would bear up with fortitude under 
this misfortune.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne's 
affliction be,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when her mother could talk of fortitude! 
mortifying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and humiliating must be the origin 
of those regrets,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which SHE could wish her not to indulge!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Against the interest of her own individual 
comfort,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood had determined that 
it would be better for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne to be any where, at that 
time, than at Barton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where every thing within her view 
would be bringing back</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the past in the strongest and most 
afflicting manner,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by constantly placing Willoughby before 
her, such as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had always seen him there. She 
recommended it to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her daughters, therefore, by all means 
not to shorten their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length 
of which, though never</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exactly fixed, had been expected by 
all to comprise at least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">five or six weeks.  A variety of occupations, 
of objects,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and of company, which could not be 
procured at Barton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would be inevitable there, and might 
yet, she hoped,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cheat Marianne, at times, into some 
interest beyond herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and even into some amusement, much 
as the ideas of both</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might now be spurned by her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">From all danger of seeing Willoughby 
again,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her mother considered her to be at 
least equally safe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in town as in the country, since his 
acquaintance must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now be dropped by all who called themselves 
her friends.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Design could never bring them in each 
other's way:</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">negligence could never leave them 
exposed to a surprise;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and chance had less in its favour 
in the crowd of London</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than even in the retirement of Barton, 
where it might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">force him before her while paying 
that visit at Allenham</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on his marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, 
from foreseeing at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">first as a probable event, had brought 
herself to expect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as a certain one.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She had yet another reason for wishing 
her children</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to remain where they were; a letter 
from her son-in-law</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had told her that he and his wife 
were to be in town</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before the middle of February, and 
she judged it right</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that they should sometimes see their 
brother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne had promised to be guided 
by her mother's opinion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she submitted to it therefore 
without opposition,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though it proved perfectly different 
from what she wished</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and expected, though she felt it to 
be entirely wrong,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">formed on mistaken grounds, and that 
by requiring her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">longer continuance in London it deprived 
her of the only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possible alleviation of her wretchedness, 
the personal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sympathy of her mother, and doomed 
her to such society and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such scenes as must prevent her ever 
knowing a moment's rest.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But it was a matter of great consolation 
to her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that what brought evil to herself 
would bring good to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister; and Elinor, on the other 
hand, suspecting that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it would not be in her power to avoid 
Edward entirely,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comforted herself by thinking, that 
though their longer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stay would therefore militate against 
her own happiness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it would be better for Marianne than 
an immediate return</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into Devonshire.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her carefulness in guarding her sister 
from ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hearing Willoughby's name mentioned, 
was not thrown away.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, though without knowing it 
herself, reaped all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, 
nor Sir John,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever 
spoke of him before her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor wished that the same forbearance 
could have extended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">towards herself, but that was impossible, 
and she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">obliged to listen day after day to 
the indignation of them all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John, could not have thought it 
possible.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;A man of whom he had always 
had such reason to think well!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Such a good-natured fellow!  He did 
not believe there was a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bolder rider in England!  It was an 
unaccountable business.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He wished him at the devil with all 
his heart.  He would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not speak another word to him, meet 
him where he might,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for all the world!  No, not if it 
were to be by the side</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Barton covert, and they were kept 
watching for two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hours together.  Such a scoundrel 
of a fellow! such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a deceitful dog!  It was only the 
last time they met</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he had offered him one of Folly's 
puppies! and this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was the end of it!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer, in her way, was equally 
angry.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She was determined to drop his 
acquaintance immediately,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she was very thankful that she 
had never been acquainted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with him at all.  She wished with 
all her heart Combe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Magna was not so near Cleveland; but 
it did not signify,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for it was a great deal too far off 
to visit; she hated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him so much that she was resolved 
never to mention</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his name again, and she should tell 
everybody she saw,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how good-for-nothing he was.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The rest of Mrs. Palmer's sympathy 
was shewn in procuring</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all the particulars in her power of 
the approaching marriage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and communicating them to Elinor.  
She could soon tell</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at what coachmaker's the new carriage 
was building,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by what painter Mr. Willoughby's portrait 
was drawn,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and at what warehouse Miss Grey's 
clothes might be seen.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The calm and polite unconcern of Lady 
Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the occasion was a happy relief 
to Elinor's spirits,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">oppressed as they often were by the 
clamorous kindness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the others.  It was a great comfort 
to her to be sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of exciting no interest in ONE person 
at least among their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">circle of friends: a great comfort 
to know that there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was ONE who would meet her without 
feeling any curiosity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after particulars, or any anxiety 
for her sister's health.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Every qualification is raised at times, 
by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">circumstances of the moment, to more 
than its real value;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she was sometimes worried down 
by officious condolence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to rate good-breeding as more indispensable 
to comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than good-nature.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton expressed her sense 
of the affair</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about once every day, or twice, if 
the subject occurred</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very often, by saying,&quot;It is 
very shocking, indeed!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and by the means of this continual 
though gentle vent, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was able not only to see the Miss 
Dashwoods from the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">first without the smallest emotion, 
but very soon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see them without recollecting a 
word of the matter;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and having thus supported the dignity 
of her own sex,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and spoken her decided censure of 
what was wrong</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the other, she thought herself 
at liberty to attend</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the interest of her own assemblies, 
and therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">determined (though rather against 
the opinion of Sir John)</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once 
be a woman of elegance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and fortune, to leave her card with 
her as soon as she married.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon's delicate, unobtrusive 
enquiries</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were never unwelcome to Miss Dashwood.  
He had abundantly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">earned the privilege of intimate discussion 
of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister's disappointment, by the friendly 
zeal with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which he had endeavoured to soften 
it, and they always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conversed with confidence.  His chief 
reward for the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">painful exertion of disclosing past 
sorrows and present</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">humiliations, was given in the pitying 
eye with which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne sometimes observed him, and 
the gentleness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her voice whenever (though it did 
not often happen)</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was obliged, or could oblige herself 
to speak to him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">THESE assured him that his exertion 
had produced an</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">increase of good-will towards himself, 
and THESE gave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor hopes of its being farther 
augmented hereafter;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing 
of all this, who knew</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only that the Colonel continued as 
grave as ever, and that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could neither prevail on him to 
make the offer himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor commission her to make it for 
him, began, at the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">end of two days, to think that, instead 
of Midsummer,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they would not be married till Michaelmas, 
and by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">end of a week that it would not be 
a match at all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The good understanding between the 
Colonel and Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dashwood seemed rather to declare 
that the honours</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and 
the yew arbour,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would all be made over to HER; and 
Mrs. Jennings had,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for some time ceased to think at all 
of Mrs. Ferrars.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Early in February, within a fortnight 
from the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">receipt of Willoughby's letter, Elinor 
had the painful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">office of informing her sister that 
he was married.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She had taken care to have the intelligence 
conveyed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to herself, as soon as it was known 
that the ceremony</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was over, as she was desirous that 
Marianne should not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">receive the first notice of it from 
the public papers,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which she saw her eagerly examining 
every morning.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She received the news with resolute 
composure;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made no observation on it, and at 
first shed no tears;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but after a short time they would 
burst out, and for the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rest of the day, she was in a state 
hardly less pitiable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than when she first learnt to expect 
the event.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Willoughbys left town as soon 
as they were married;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor now hoped, as there could 
be no danger</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her seeing either of them, to prevail 
on her sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who had never yet left the house since 
the blow first fell,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to go out again by degrees as she 
had done before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">About this time the two Miss Steeles, 
lately arrived</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at their cousin's house in Bartlett's 
Buildings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Holburn, presented themselves again 
before their more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley 
Streets;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and were welcomed by them all with 
great cordiality.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor only was sorry to see them.  
Their presence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">always gave her pain, and she hardly 
knew how to make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a very gracious return to the overpowering 
delight of Lucy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in finding her STILL in town.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I should have been quite disappointed 
if I had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">found you here STILL,&quot; said she 
repeatedly, with a strong</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">emphasis on the word.  &quot;But I 
always thought I SHOULD.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I was almost sure you would not leave 
London yet awhile;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though you TOLD me, you know, at Barton, 
that you should</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not stay above a MONTH.  But I thought, 
at the time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that you would most likely change 
your mind when it came</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the point.  It would have been 
such a great pity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to have went away before your brother 
and sister came.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And now to be sure you will be in 
no hurry to be gone.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am amazingly glad you did not keep 
to YOUR WORD.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor perfectly understood her, and 
was forced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to use all her self-command to make 
it appear that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">did NOT.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; said Mrs. 
Jennings, &quot;and how did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you travel?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Not in the stage, I assure you,&quot; 
replied Miss Steele,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with quick exultation; &quot;we came 
post all the way, and had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a very smart beau to attend us.  Dr. 
Davies was coming</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to town, and so we thought we'd join 
him in a post-chaise;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he behaved very genteelly, and 
paid ten or twelve</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shillings more than we did.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, oh!&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings; 
&quot;very pretty,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indeed! and the Doctor is a single 
man, I warrant you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There now,&quot; said Miss Steele, 
affectedly simpering,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;everybody laughs at me so about 
the Doctor, and I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cannot think why. My cousins say they 
are sure I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made a conquest; but for my part I 
declare I never think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about him from one hour's end to another.  
'Lord! here</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comes your beau, Nancy,' my cousin 
said t'other day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when she saw him crossing the street 
to the house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My beau, indeed! said I--I cannot 
think who you mean.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Doctor is no beau of mine.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Aye, aye, that is very pretty 
talking--but it won't do--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the Doctor is the man, I see.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, indeed!&quot; replied her 
cousin, with affected earnestness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;and I beg you will contradict 
it, if you ever hear it talked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings directly gave her the 
gratifying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assurance that she certainly would 
NOT, and Miss Steele</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was made completely happy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I suppose you will go and stay 
with your brother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sister, Miss Dashwood, when they 
come to town,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Lucy, returning, after a cessation 
of hostile hints,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the charge.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, I do not think we shall.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, yes, I dare say you will.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor would not humour her by farther 
opposition.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What a charming thing it is 
that Mrs. Dashwood can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spare you both for so long a time 
together!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Long a time, indeed!&quot; interposed 
Mrs. Jennings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why, their visit is but just 
begun!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy was silenced.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am sorry we cannot see your 
sister, Miss Dashwood,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Miss Steele. &quot;I am sorry 
she is not well--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Marianne had left the room on 
their arrival.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are very good.  My sister 
will be equally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sorry to miss the pleasure of seeing 
you; but she has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been very much plagued lately with 
nervous head-aches,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which make her unfit for company or 
conversation.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, dear, that is a great pity! 
but such old</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">friends as Lucy and me!--I think she 
might see US;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I am sure we would not speak a 
word.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, with great civility, declined 
the proposal.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her sister was perhaps laid down upon 
the bed, or in her </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dressing gown, and therefore not able 
to come to them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, if that's all,&quot; cried 
Miss Steele, &quot;we can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">just as well go and see HER.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor began to find this impertinence 
too much for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her temper; but she was saved the 
trouble of checking it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Lucy's sharp reprimand, which now, 
as on many occasions,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though it did not give much sweetness 
to the manners</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of one sister, was of advantage in 
governing those of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the other.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 33</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After some opposition, Marianne yielded 
to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister's entreaties, and consented 
to go out with her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Jennings one morning for 
half an hour. She</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expressly conditioned, however, for 
paying no visits,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and would do no more than accompany 
them to Gray's in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sackville Street, where Elinor was 
carrying on a negotiation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the exchange of a few old-fashioned 
jewels of her mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When they stopped at the door, Mrs. 
Jennings recollected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that there was a lady at the other 
end of the street</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on whom she ought to call; and as 
she had no business</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Gray's, it was resolved, that while 
her young friends</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">transacted their's, she should pay 
her visit and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">return for them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On ascending the stairs, the Miss 
Dashwoods found</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so many people before them in the 
room, that there was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not a person at liberty to tend to 
their orders; and they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were obliged to wait.  All that could 
be done was, to sit</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">down at that end of the counter which 
seemed to promise the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quickest succession; one gentleman 
only was standing there,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it is probable that Elinor was 
not without hope</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of exciting his politeness to a quicker 
despatch.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But the correctness of his eye, and 
the delicacy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his taste, proved to be beyond 
his politeness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was giving orders for a toothpick-case 
for himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and till its size, shape, and ornaments 
were determined,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all of which, after examining and 
debating for a quarter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of an hour over every toothpick-case 
in the shop,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were finally arranged by his own inventive 
fancy, he had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no leisure to bestow any other attention 
on the two ladies,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than what was comprised in three or 
four very broad stares;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a kind of notice which served to imprint 
on Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the remembrance of a person and face, 
of strong,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">natural, sterling insignificance, 
though adorned in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the first style of fashion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was spared from the troublesome 
feelings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of contempt and resentment, on this 
impertinent examination</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their features, and on the puppyism 
of his manner</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in deciding on all the different horrors 
of the different</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">toothpick-cases presented to his inspection, 
by remaining</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unconscious of it all; for she was 
as well able to collect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her thoughts within herself, and be 
as ignorant of what was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">passing around her, in Mr. Gray's 
shop, as in her own bedroom.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At last the affair was decided.  The 
ivory,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the gold, and the pearls, all received 
their appointment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the gentleman having named the 
last day on which his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">existence could be continued without 
the possession of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">toothpick-case, drew on his gloves 
with leisurely care,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and bestowing another glance on the 
Miss Dashwoods, but such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a one as seemed rather to demand than 
express admiration,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">walked off with a happy air of real 
conceit and affected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indifference.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor lost no time in bringing her 
business forward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was on the point of concluding it, 
when another gentleman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">presented himself at her side.  She 
turned her eyes towards </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his face, and found him with some 
surprise to be her brother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their affection and pleasure in meeting 
was just enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make a very creditable appearance 
in Mr. Gray's shop.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">John Dashwood was really far from 
being sorry to see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his sisters again; it rather gave 
them satisfaction;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his inquiries after their mother 
were respectful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and attentive.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor found that he and Fanny had 
been in town</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two days.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I wished very much to call upon 
you yesterday,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said he, &quot;but it was impossible, 
for we were obliged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to take Harry to see the wild beasts 
at Exeter Exchange;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and we spent the rest of the day with 
Mrs. Ferrars.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Harry was vastly pleased. THIS morning 
I had fully intended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to call on you, if I could possibly 
find a spare half hour,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but one has always so much to do on 
first coming to town.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am come here to bespeak Fanny a 
seal.  But tomorrow I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think I shall certainly be able to 
call in Berkeley Street,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and be introduced to your friend Mrs. 
Jennings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I understand she is a woman of very 
good fortune.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And the Middletons too, you must introduce 
me to THEM.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As my mother-in-law's relations, I 
shall be happy to show</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them every respect.  They are excellent 
neighbours to you in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the country, I understand.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Excellent indeed.  Their attention 
to our comfort,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their friendliness in every particular, 
is more than I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can express.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am extremely glad to hear 
it, upon my word;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">extremely glad indeed.  But so it 
ought to be; they are </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">people of large fortune, they are 
related to you, and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every civility and accommodation that 
can serve to make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your situation pleasant might be reasonably 
expected.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And so you are most comfortably settled 
in your little cottage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and want for nothing!  Edward brought 
us a most charming</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">account of the place: the most complete 
thing of its kind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he said, that ever was, and you all 
seemed to enjoy it beyond</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any thing.  It was a great satisfaction 
to us to hear it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I assure you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor did feel a little ashamed of 
her brother;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and was not sorry to be spared the 
necessity of answering him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the arrival of Mrs. Jennings's 
servant, who came to tell</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her that his mistress waited for them 
at the door.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, 
was introduced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Mrs. Jennings at the door of her 
carriage, and repeating</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his hope of being able to call on 
them the next day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">took leave.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His visit was duly paid.  He came 
with a pretence at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an apology from their sister-in-law, 
for not coming too;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;but she was so much engaged 
with her mother, that really</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had no leisure for going any where.&quot;  
Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, assured him directly, that 
she should not stand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, 
or something</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">like it, and she should certainly 
wait on Mrs. John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dashwood very soon, and bring her 
sisters to see her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His manners to THEM, though calm, 
were perfectly kind;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively 
civil; and on Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon's coming in soon after himself, 
he eyed him with a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">curiosity which seemed to say, that 
he only wanted to know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him to be rich, to be equally civil 
to HIM.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After staying with them half an hour, 
he asked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor to walk with him to Conduit 
Street, and introduce</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him to Sir John and Lady Middleton.  
The weather was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">remarkably fine, and she readily consented.  
As soon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as they were out of the house, his 
enquiries began.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Who is Colonel Brandon?  Is 
he a man of fortune?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes; he has very good property 
in Dorsetshire.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am glad of it.  He seems a 
most gentlemanlike man;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I think, Elinor, I may congratulate 
you on the prospect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a very respectable establishment 
in life.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Me, brother! what do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He likes you.  I observed him 
narrowly, and am</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">convinced of it.  What is the amount 
of his fortune?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I believe about two thousand 
a year.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Two thousand a-year;&quot; and 
then working himself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity, 
he added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Elinor, I wish with all my heart 
it were TWICE as much,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for your sake.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed I believe you,&quot; 
replied Elinor; &quot;but I am</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very sure that Colonel Brandon has 
not the smallest wish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of marrying ME.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are mistaken, Elinor; you 
are very much mistaken.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A very little trouble on your side 
secures him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Perhaps just at present he may be 
undecided; the smallness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of your fortune may make him hang 
back; his friends</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may all advise him against it.  But 
some of those little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attentions and encouragements which 
ladies can so easily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">give will fix him, in spite of himself.  
And there can be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no reason why you should not try for 
him.  It is not to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">supposed that any prior attachment 
on your side--in short,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know as to an attachment of that 
kind, it is quite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out of the question, the objections 
are insurmountable--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you have too much sense not to see 
all that.  Colonel Brandon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be the man; and no civility shall 
be wanting on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my part to make him pleased with you 
and your family.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is a match that must give universal 
satisfaction.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In short, it is a kind of thing that&quot;--lowering 
his voice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to an important whisper--&quot;will 
be exceedingly welcome</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to ALL PARTIES.&quot;Recollecting 
himself, however, he added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is, I mean to say--your 
friends are all truly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">anxious to see you well settled; Fanny 
particularly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for she has your interest very much 
at heart, I assure you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And her mother too, Mrs. Ferrars, 
a very good-natured woman,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure it would give her great 
pleasure; she said as much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the other day.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It would be something remarkable, 
now,&quot; he continued,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;something droll, if Fanny should 
have a brother and I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a sister settling at the same time.  
And yet it is not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very unlikely.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,&quot; 
said Elinor, with resolution,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;going to be married?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is not actually settled, 
but there is such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a thing in agitation.  He has a most 
excellent mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality, 
will come forward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and settle on him a thousand a year, 
if the match</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">takes place.  The lady is the Hon. 
Miss Morton, only daughter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the late Lord Morton, with thirty 
thousand pounds.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A very desirable connection on both 
sides, and I have not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a doubt of its taking place in time.  
A thousand a-year</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is a great deal for a mother to give 
away, to make over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble 
spirit.  To give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you another instance of her liberality:--The 
other day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as we came to town, aware 
that money could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not be very plenty with us just now, 
she put bank-notes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into Fanny's hands to the amount of 
two hundred pounds.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And extremely acceptable it is, for 
we must live at a great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expense while we are here.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He paused for her assent and compassion; 
and she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">forced herself to say,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your expenses both in town and 
country must certainly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be considerable; but your income is 
a large one.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Not so large, I dare say, as 
many people suppose.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I do not mean to complain, however; 
it is undoubtedly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a comfortable one, and I hope will 
in time be better.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The enclosure of Norland Common, now 
carrying on,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is a most serious drain.  And then 
I have made a little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">purchase within this half year; East 
Kingham Farm,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you must remember the place, where 
old Gibson used to live.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The land was so very desirable for 
me in every respect,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so immediately adjoining my own property, 
that I felt it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my duty to buy it.  I could not have 
answered it to my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conscience to let it fall into any 
other hands.  A man must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pay for his convenience; and it HAS 
cost me a vast deal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of money.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;More than you think it really 
and intrinsically worth.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why, I hope not that.  I might 
have sold it again,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the next day, for more than I gave: 
but, with regard to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">purchase-money, I might have been 
very unfortunate indeed;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the stocks were at that time so 
low, that if I had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happened to have the necessary sum 
in my banker's hands,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I must have sold out to very great 
loss.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could only smile.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Other great and inevitable expenses 
too we have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had on first coming to Norland. Our 
respected father,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as you well know, bequeathed all the 
Stanhill effects</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that remained at Norland (and very 
valuable they were)</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to your mother.  Far be it from me 
to repine at his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">doing so; he had an undoubted right 
to dispose of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">own property as he chose, but, in 
consequence of it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">we have been obliged to make large 
purchases of linen,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">china, &amp;c. to supply the place 
of what was taken away.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You may guess, after all these expenses, 
how very far we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be from being rich, and how acceptable 
Mrs. Ferrars's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">kindness is.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly,&quot; said Elinor; 
&quot;and assisted by her liberality,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I hope you may yet live to be in easy 
circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Another year or two may do much 
towards it,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he gravely replied; &quot;but however 
there is still a great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">deal to be done.  There is not a stone 
laid of Fanny's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">green-house, and nothing but the plan 
of the flower-garden</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">marked out.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Where is the green-house to 
be?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon the knoll behind the house.  
The old</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">walnut trees are all come down to 
make room for it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It will be a very fine object from 
many parts of the park,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the flower-garden will slope down 
just before it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and be exceedingly pretty.  We have 
cleared away all the old</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thorns that grew in patches over the 
brow.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor kept her concern and her censure 
to herself;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and was very thankful that Marianne 
was not present,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to share the provocation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Having now said enough to make his 
poverty clear,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to do away the necessity of buying 
a pair of ear-rings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for each of his sisters, in his next 
visit at Gray's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, 
and he began to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">congratulate Elinor on having such 
a friend as Mrs. Jennings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She seems a most valuable woman 
indeed--Her house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her style of living, all bespeak an 
exceeding good income;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it is an acquaintance that has 
not only been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of great use to you hitherto, but 
in the end may prove</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">materially advantageous.--Her inviting 
you to town is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">certainly a vast thing in your favour; 
and indeed, it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">speaks altogether so great a regard 
for you, that in all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">probability when she dies you will 
not be forgotten.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She must have a great deal to leave.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Nothing at all, I should rather 
suppose; for she has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only her jointure, which will descend 
to her children.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But it is not to be imagined 
that she lives up to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her income.  Few people of common 
prudence will do THAT;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and whatever she saves, she will be 
able to dispose of.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And do you not think it more 
likely that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should leave it to her daughters, 
than to us?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Her daughters are both exceedingly 
well married,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and therefore I cannot perceive the 
necessity of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">remembering them farther.  Whereas, 
in my opinion, by her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">taking so much notice of you, and 
treating you in this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">kind of way, she has given you a sort 
of claim on her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">future consideration, which a conscientious 
woman would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not disregard.  Nothing can be kinder 
than her behaviour;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she can hardly do all this, without 
being aware</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the expectation it raises.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But she raises none in those 
most concerned.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Indeed, brother, your anxiety for 
our welfare and prosperity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">carries you too far.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why, to be sure,&quot; said 
he, seeming to recollect himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;people have little, have very 
little in their power.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But, my dear Elinor, what is the matter 
with Marianne?--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she looks very unwell, has lost her 
colour, and is grown</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite thin.  Is she ill?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She is not well, she has had 
a nervous complaint</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her for several weeks.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am sorry for that.  At her 
time of life,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any thing of an illness destroys the 
bloom for ever! </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her's has been a very short one!  
She was as handsome a girl</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">last September, as I ever saw; and 
as likely to attract</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the man.  There was something in her 
style of beauty, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to please them particularly. I remember 
Fanny used to say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she would marry sooner and better 
than you did;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not but what she is exceedingly fond 
of YOU, but so it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happened to strike her.  She will 
be mistaken, however.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I question whether Marianne NOW, will 
marry a man worth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more than five or six hundred a-year, 
at the utmost,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I am very much deceived if YOU 
do not do better.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dorsetshire! I know very little of 
Dorsetshire; but, my dear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad 
to know more of it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I think I can answer for your 
having Fanny and myself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">among the earliest and best pleased 
of your visitors.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor tried very seriously to convince 
him that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there was no likelihood of her marrying 
Colonel Brandon;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it was an expectation of too much 
pleasure to himself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be relinquished, and he was really 
resolved on seeking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an intimacy with that gentleman, and 
promoting the marriage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by every possible attention.  He had 
just compunction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enough for having done nothing for 
his sisters himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be exceedingly anxious that everybody 
else should</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">do a great deal; and an offer from 
Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was 
the easiest means</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of atoning for his own neglect.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were lucky enough to find Lady 
Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at home, and Sir John came in before 
their visit ended.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Abundance of civilities passed on 
all sides.  Sir John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was ready to like anybody, and though 
Mr. Dashwood did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not seem to know much about horses, 
he soon set him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">down as a very good-natured fellow: 
while Lady Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">saw enough of fashion in his appearance 
to think his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acquaintance worth having; and Mr. 
Dashwood went away</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">delighted with both.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I shall have a charming account 
to carry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Fanny,&quot; said he, as he walked 
back with his sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Lady Middleton is really a most 
elegant woman!  Such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a woman as I am sure Fanny will be 
glad to know.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And Mrs. Jennings too, an exceedingly 
well-behaved woman,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though not so elegant as her daughter.  
Your sister need</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not have any scruple even of visiting 
HER, which, to say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the truth, has been a little the case, 
and very naturally;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings 
was the widow of a man</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who had got all his money in a low 
way; and Fanny and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars were both strongly prepossessed, 
that neither</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she nor her daughters were such kind 
of women as Fanny</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would like to associate with.  But 
now I can carry her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a most satisfactory account of both.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 34</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence 
in her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">husband's judgment, that she waited 
the very next day</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">both on Mrs. Jennings and her daughter; 
and her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">confidence was rewarded by finding 
even the former,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even the woman with whom her sisters 
were staying,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by no means unworthy her notice; and 
as for Lady Middleton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she found her one of the most charming 
women in the world!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton was equally pleased 
with Mrs. Dashwood.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">There was a kind of cold hearted selfishness 
on both sides,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which mutually attracted them; and 
they sympathised</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with each other in an insipid propriety 
of demeanor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a general want of understanding.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The same manners, however, which recommended 
Mrs. John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Dashwood to the good opinion of Lady 
Middleton did not suit</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the fancy of Mrs. Jennings, and to 
HER she appeared nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more than a little proud-looking woman 
of uncordial address,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who met her husband's sisters without 
any affection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and almost without having anything 
to say to them;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for of the quarter of an hour bestowed 
on Berkeley Street,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she sat at least seven minutes and 
a half in silence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor wanted very much to know, though 
she did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not chuse to ask, whether Edward was 
then in town;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but nothing would have induced Fanny 
voluntarily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to mention his name before her, till 
able to tell her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that his marriage with Miss Morton 
was resolved on,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or till her husband's expectations 
on Colonel Brandon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were answered; because she believed 
them still so very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much attached to each other, that 
they could not be too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sedulously divided in word and deed 
on every occasion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The intelligence however, which SHE 
would not give,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">soon flowed from another quarter.  
Lucy came very shortly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to claim Elinor's compassion on being 
unable to see Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though he had arrived in town with 
Mr. and Mrs. Dashwood.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He dared not come to Bartlett's Buildings 
for fear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of detection, and though their mutual 
impatience to meet,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not to be told, they could do 
nothing at present</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but write.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward assured them himself of his 
being in town,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">within a very short time, by twice 
calling in Berkeley Street.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Twice was his card found on the table, 
when they returned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from their morning's engagements.  
Elinor was pleased</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he had called; and still more 
pleased that she had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">missed him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Dashwoods were so prodigiously 
delighted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the Middletons, that, though 
not much in the habit</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of giving anything, they determined 
to give them--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance 
began,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">invited them to dine in Harley Street, 
where they had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">taken a very good house for three 
months.  Their sisters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Jennings were invited likewise, 
and John Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, 
who, always glad</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, 
received his eager</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">civilities with some surprise, but 
much more pleasure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were to meet Mrs. Ferrars; but 
Elinor could not learn</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whether her sons were to be of the 
party.  The expectation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of seeing HER, however, was enough 
to make her interested</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the engagement; for though she 
could now meet Edward's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother without that strong anxiety 
which had once promised</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to attend such an introduction, though 
she could now see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her with perfect indifference as to 
her opinion of herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her desire of being in company with 
Mrs. Ferrars,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her curiosity to know what she was 
like, was as lively as ever.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The interest with which she thus anticipated 
the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">party, was soon afterwards increased, 
more powerfully</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than pleasantly, by her hearing that 
the Miss Steeles</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were also to be at it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">So well had they recommended themselves 
to Lady Middleton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so agreeable had their assiduities 
made them to her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that though Lucy was certainly not 
so elegant, and her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister not even genteel, she was as 
ready as Sir John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to ask them to spend a week or two 
in Conduit Street;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it happened to be particularly 
convenient to the Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Steeles, as soon as the Dashwoods' 
invitation was known,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that their visit should begin a few 
days before the party</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">took place.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their claims to the notice of Mrs. 
John Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the nieces of the gentleman who 
for many years had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had the care of her brother, might 
not have done much,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, towards procuring them seats 
at her table;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but as Lady Middleton's guests they 
must be welcome; and Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who had long wanted to be personally 
known to the family,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to have a nearer view of their characters 
and her own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">difficulties, and to have an opportunity 
of endeavouring</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to please them, had seldom been happier 
in her life,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than she was on receiving Mrs. John 
Dashwood's card.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On Elinor its effect was very different.  
She began</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately to determine, that Edward 
who lived with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his mother, must be asked as his mother 
was, to a party</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">given by his sister; and to see him 
for the first time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after all that passed, in the company 
of Lucy!--she hardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">knew how she could bear it!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">These apprehensions, perhaps, were 
not founded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entirely on reason, and certainly 
not at all on truth.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were relieved however, not by 
her own recollection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but by the good will of Lucy, who 
believed herself to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inflicting a severe disappointment 
when she told her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Edward certainly would not be 
in Harley Street on Tuesday,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and even hoped to be carrying the 
pain still farther</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by persuading her that he was kept 
away by the extreme</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection for herself, which he could 
not conceal when they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were together.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The important Tuesday came that was 
to introduce</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the two young ladies to this formidable 
mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!&quot; 
said Lucy, as they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">walked up the stairs together--for 
the Middletons arrived</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so directly after Mrs. Jennings, that 
they all followed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the servant at the same time--&quot;There 
is nobody here but</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you, that can feel for me.--I declare 
I can hardly stand.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Good gracious!--In a moment I shall 
see the person that all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my happiness depends on--that is to 
be my mother!&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could have given her immediate 
relief</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by suggesting the possibility of its 
being Miss Morton's mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rather than her own, whom they were 
about to behold;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but instead of doing that, she assured 
her, and with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great sincerity, that she did pity 
her--to the utter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">amazement of Lucy, who, though really 
uncomfortable herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hoped at least to be an object of 
irrepressible envy to Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, 
upright,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even to formality, in her figure, 
and serious,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even to sourness, in her aspect.  
Her complexion was sallow;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her features small, without beauty, 
and naturally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without expression; but a lucky contraction 
of the brow</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had rescued her countenance from the 
disgrace of insipidity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by giving it the strong characters 
of pride and ill nature.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was not a woman of many words; 
for, unlike people</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in general, she proportioned them 
to the number of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her ideas; and of the few syllables 
that did escape her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not one fell to the share of Miss 
Dashwood, whom she eyed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the spirited determination of 
disliking her at all events.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not NOW be made unhappy 
by this behaviour.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A few months ago it would have hurt 
her exceedingly; but it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not in Mrs. Ferrars' power to 
distress her by it now;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the difference of her manners 
to the Miss Steeles,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a difference which seemed purposely 
made to humble her more,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only amused her.  She could not but 
smile to see the graciousness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of both mother and daughter towards 
the very person--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Lucy was particularly distinguished--whom 
of all others,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had they known as much as she did, 
they would have been most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">anxious to mortify; while she herself, 
who had comparatively</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no power to wound them, sat pointedly 
slighted by both.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But while she smiled at a graciousness 
so misapplied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could not reflect on the mean-spirited 
folly from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which it sprung, nor observe the studied 
attentions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with which the Miss Steeles courted 
its continuance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without thoroughly despising them 
all four.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy was all exultation on being so 
honorably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">distinguished; and Miss Steele wanted 
only to be teazed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about Dr. Davis to be perfectly happy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The dinner was a grand one, the servants 
were numerous,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and every thing bespoke the Mistress's 
inclination</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for show, and the Master's ability 
to support it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In spite of the improvements and additions 
which were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">making to the Norland estate, and 
in spite of its owner</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">having once been within some thousand 
pounds of being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">obliged to sell out at a loss, nothing 
gave any symptom</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of that indigence which he had tried 
to infer from it;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no poverty of any kind, except of 
conversation, appeared--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but there, the deficiency was considerable.  
John Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had not much to say for himself that 
was worth hearing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his wife had still less.  But 
there was no peculiar</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disgrace in this; for it was very 
much the case with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the chief of their visitors, who almost 
all laboured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">under one or other of these disqualifications 
for being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">agreeable--Want of sense, either natural 
or improved--want</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of elegance--want of spirits--or want 
of temper.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after dinner, this poverty was particularly 
evident,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the gentlemen HAD supplied the 
discourse with some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">variety--the variety of politics, 
inclosing land,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and breaking horses--but then it was 
all over; and one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subject only engaged the ladies till 
coffee came in,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which was the comparative heights 
of Harry Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Lady Middleton's second son William, 
who were nearly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the same age.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Had both the children been there, 
the affair might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been determined too easily by 
measuring them at once;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but as Harry only was present, it 
was all conjectural</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assertion on both sides; and every 
body had a right to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be equally positive in their opinion, 
and to repeat it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">over and over again as often as they 
liked.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The parties stood thus: </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The two mothers, though each really 
convinced that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her own son was the tallest, politely 
decided in favour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the other.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The two grandmothers, with not less 
partiality,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but more sincerity, were equally earnest 
in support</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their own descendant.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy, who was hardly less anxious 
to please one parent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than the other, thought the boys were 
both remarkably tall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for their age, and could not conceive 
that there could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be the smallest difference in the 
world between them;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Miss Steele, with yet greater 
address gave it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as fast as she could, in favour of 
each.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, having once delivered her 
opinion on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">William's side, by which she offended 
Mrs. Ferrars and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fanny still more, did not see the 
necessity of enforcing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, 
when called</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on for her's, offended them all, by 
declaring that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had no opinion to give, as she had 
never thought about it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Before her removing from Norland, 
Elinor had painted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a very pretty pair of screens for 
her sister-in-law,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which being now just mounted and brought 
home,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ornamented her present drawing room; 
and these screens,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">catching the eye of John Dashwood 
on his following</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the other gentlemen into the room, 
were officiously</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">handed by him to Colonel Brandon for 
his admiration.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;These are done by my eldest 
sister,&quot;said he; &quot;and you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as a man of taste, will, I dare say, 
be pleased with them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I do not know whether you have ever 
happened to see any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her performances before, but she 
is in general reckoned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to draw extremely well.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Colonel, though disclaiming all 
pretensions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to connoisseurship, warmly admired 
the screens, as he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would have done any thing painted 
by Miss Dashwood;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and on the curiosity of the others 
being of course excited,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they were handed round for general 
inspection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars, not aware of their being 
Elinor's work,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">particularly requested to look at 
them; and after they had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">received gratifying testimony of Lady 
Middletons's approbation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fanny presented them to her mother, 
considerately informing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her, at the same time, that they were 
done by Miss Dashwood.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Hum&quot;--said Mrs. Ferrars--&quot;very 
pretty,&quot;--and without</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">regarding them at all, returned them 
to her daughter.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment 
that her mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been quite rude enough,--for, 
colouring a little,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she immediately said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;They are very pretty, ma'am--an't 
they?&quot; But then again,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the dread of having been too civil, 
too encouraging herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">probably came over her, for she presently 
added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do you not think they are something 
in Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Morton's style of painting, Ma'am?--She 
DOES paint most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">delightfully!--How beautifully her 
last landscape is done!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Beautifully indeed!  But SHE 
does every thing well.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne could not bear this.--She 
was already</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">greatly displeased with Mrs. Ferrars; 
and such ill-timed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">praise of another, at Elinor's expense, 
though she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had not any notion of what was principally 
meant by it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">provoked her immediately to say with 
warmth,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;This is admiration of a very 
particular kind!--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what is Miss Morton to us?--who knows, 
or who cares,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her?--it is Elinor of whom WE 
think and speak.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And so saying, she took the screens 
out of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister-in-law's hands, to admire them 
herself as they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ought to be admired.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, 
and drawing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself up more stiffly than ever, 
pronounced in retort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this bitter philippic, &quot;Miss 
Morton is Lord Morton's daughter.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fanny looked very angry too, and her 
husband was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all in a fright at his sister's audacity.  
Elinor was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much more hurt by Marianne's warmth 
than she had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon's 
eyes, as they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were fixed on Marianne, declared that 
he noticed only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what was amiable in it, the affectionate 
heart which could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not bear to see a sister slighted 
in the smallest point.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's feelings did not stop here.  
The cold</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">insolence of Mrs. Ferrars's general 
behaviour to her sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed, to her, to foretell such difficulties 
and distresses</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Elinor, as her own wounded heart 
taught her to think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of with horror; and urged by a strong 
impulse of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affectionate sensibility, she moved 
after a moment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her sister's chair, and putting 
one arm round her neck,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and one cheek close to hers, said 
in a low, but eager,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">voice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Dear, dear Elinor, don't mind 
them.  Don't let them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">make YOU unhappy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She could say no more; her spirits 
were quite overcome,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and hiding her face on Elinor's shoulder, 
she burst</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into tears.  Every body's attention 
was called, and almost</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every body was concerned.--Colonel 
Brandon rose up and went</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to them without knowing what he did.--Mrs. 
Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a very intelligent &quot;Ah! 
poor dear,&quot; immediately gave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her her salts; and Sir John felt so 
desperately enraged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against the author of this nervous 
distress, that he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">instantly changed his seat to one 
close by Lucy Steele,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and gave her, in a whisper, a brief 
account of the whole</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shocking affair.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In a few minutes, however, Marianne 
was recovered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enough to put an end to the bustle, 
and sit down among</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the rest; though her spirits retained 
the impression</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what had passed, the whole evening.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Poor Marianne!&quot; said her 
brother to Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a low voice, as soon as he could 
secure his attention,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She has not such good health 
as her sister,--she is very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nervous,--she has not Elinor's constitution;--and 
one must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">allow that there is something very 
trying to a young woman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who HAS BEEN a beauty in the loss 
of her personal attractions.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You would not think it perhaps, but 
Marianne WAS remarkably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">handsome a few months ago; quite as 
handsome as Elinor.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Now you see it is all gone.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 35</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars 
was satisfied.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She had found in her every thing that 
could tend to make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a farther connection between the families 
undesirable.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She had seen enough of her pride, 
her meanness, and her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">determined prejudice against herself, 
to comprehend all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the difficulties that must have perplexed 
the engagement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and retarded the marriage, of Edward 
and herself, had he been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">otherwise free;--and she had seen 
almost enough to be thankful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her OWN sake, that one greater 
obstacle preserved her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from suffering under any other of 
Mrs. Ferrars's creation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">preserved her from all dependence 
upon her caprice, or any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">solicitude for her good opinion.  
Or at least, if she did not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bring herself quite to rejoice in 
Edward's being fettered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Lucy, she determined, that had 
Lucy been more amiable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she OUGHT to have rejoiced.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She wondered that Lucy's spirits could 
be so very much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars;--that 
her interest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her vanity should so very much 
blind her as to make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the attention which seemed only paid 
her because she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">NOT ELINOR, appear a compliment to 
herself--or to allow</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her to derive encouragement from a 
preference only given her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because her real situation was unknown.  
But that it was so,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had not only been declared by Lucy's 
eyes at the time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but was declared over again the next 
morning more openly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for at her particular desire, Lady 
Middleton set her down</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Berkeley Street on the chance of 
seeing Elinor alone,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to tell her how happy she was.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The chance proved a lucky one, for 
a message from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer soon after she arrived, 
carried Mrs. Jennings away.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My dear friend,&quot; cried 
Lucy, as soon as they were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by themselves, &quot;I come to talk 
to you of my happiness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Could anything be so flattering as 
Mrs. Ferrars's way</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of treating me yesterday?  So exceeding 
affable as she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was!--You know how I dreaded the thoughts 
of seeing her;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the very moment I was introduced, 
there was such an</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affability in her behaviour as really 
should seem to say,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had quite took a fancy to me.  
Now was not it so?--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You saw it all; and was not you quite 
struck with it?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She was certainly very civil 
to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Civil!--Did you see nothing 
but only civility?--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I saw a vast deal more.  Such kindness 
as fell to the share</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of nobody but me!--No pride, no hauteur, 
and your sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">just the same--all sweetness and affability!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor wished to talk of something 
else, but Lucy still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pressed her to own that she had reason 
for her happiness;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor was obliged to go on.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Undoubtedly, if they had known 
your engagement,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said she, &quot;nothing could be more 
flattering than their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">treatment of you;--but as that was 
not the case&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I guessed you would say so&quot;--replied 
Lucy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quickly--&quot;but there was no reason 
in the world why</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, 
if she did not,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her liking me is every thing.  
You shan't talk me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out of my satisfaction.  I am sure 
it will all end well,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and there will be no difficulties 
at all, to what I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">used to think.  Mrs. Ferrars is a 
charming woman,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so is your sister.  They are both 
delightful women,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indeed!--I wonder I should never hear 
you say how agreeable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood was!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To this Elinor had no answer to make, 
and did not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attempt any.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?--you 
seem low--you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">don't speak;--sure you an't well.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I never was in better health.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am glad of it with all my 
heart; but really you did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not look it.  I should be sorry to 
have YOU ill; you, that have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been the greatest comfort to me in 
the world!--Heaven</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">knows what I should have done without 
your friendship.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor tried to make a civil answer, 
though doubting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her own success.  But it seemed to 
satisfy Lucy, for she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">directly replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed I am perfectly convinced 
of your regard</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for me, and next to Edward's love, 
it is the greatest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comfort I have.--Poor Edward!--But 
now there is one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good thing, we shall be able to meet, 
and meet pretty often,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Lady Middleton's delighted with 
Mrs. Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so we shall be a good deal in Harley 
Street, I dare say,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Edward spends half his time with 
his sister--besides,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will 
visit now;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were 
both so good to say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more than once, they should always 
be glad to see me.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They are such charming women!--I am 
sure if ever you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tell your sister what I think of her, 
you cannot speak</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too high.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Elinor would not give her any 
encouragement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to hope that she SHOULD tell her sister.  
Lucy continued.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am sure I should have seen 
it in a moment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if Mrs. Ferrars had took a dislike 
to me.  If she had only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made me a formal courtesy, for instance, 
without saying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a word, and never after had took any 
notice of me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and never looked at me in a pleasant 
way--you know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what I mean--if I had been treated 
in that forbidding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sort of way, I should have gave it 
all up in despair.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I could not have stood it.  For where 
she DOES dislike,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I know it is most violent.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was prevented from making any 
reply to this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">civil triumph, by the door's being 
thrown open, the servant's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">announcing Mr. Ferrars, and Edward's 
immediately walking in.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was a very awkward moment; and 
the countenance of each</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shewed that it was so.  They all looked 
exceedingly foolish;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Edward seemed to have as great 
an inclination to walk</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out of the room again, as to advance 
farther into it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest 
form,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which they would each have been most 
anxious to avoid,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had fallen on them.--They were not 
only all three together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but were together without the relief 
of any other person.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The ladies recovered themselves first.  
It was not Lucy's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">business to put herself forward, and 
the appearance of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">secrecy must still be kept up. She 
could therefore only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">LOOK her tenderness, and after slightly 
addressing him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said no more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Elinor had more to do; and so 
anxious was she,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for his sake and her own, to do it 
well, that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">forced herself, after a moment's recollection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to welcome him, with a look and manner 
that were almost easy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and almost open; and another struggle, 
another effort still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">improved them. She would not allow 
the presence of Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor the consciousness of some injustice 
towards herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to deter her from saying that she 
was happy to see him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that she had very much regretted 
being from home,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when he called before in Berkeley 
Street.  She would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not be frightened from paying him 
those attentions which,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as a friend and almost a relation, 
were his due, by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">observant eyes of Lucy, though she 
soon perceived them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be narrowly watching her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her manners gave some re-assurance 
to Edward, and he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had courage enough to sit down; but 
his embarrassment still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion, 
which the case</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rendered reasonable, though his sex 
might make it rare;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for his heart had not the indifference 
of Lucy's, nor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could his conscience have quite the 
ease of Elinor's.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy, with a demure and settled air, 
seemed determined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make no contribution to the comfort 
of the others,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and would not say a word; and almost 
every thing that WAS</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said, proceeded from Elinor, who was 
obliged to volunteer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all the information about her mother's 
health, their coming</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to town, &amp;c. which Edward ought 
to have inquired about,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but never did.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her exertions did not stop here; for 
she soon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">afterwards felt herself so heroically 
disposed as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to determine, under pretence of fetching 
Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to leave the others by themselves; 
and she really did it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and THAT in the handsomest manner, 
for she loitered away</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">several minutes on the landing-place, 
with the most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">high-minded fortitude, before she 
went to her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When that was once done, however, 
it was time for the raptures</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Edward to cease; for Marianne's 
joy hurried her into</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the drawing-room immediately.  Her 
pleasure in seeing him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was like every other of her feelings, 
strong in itself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and strongly spoken.  She met him 
with a hand that would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be taken, and a voice that expressed 
the affection of a sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Dear Edward!&quot; she cried,&quot;this 
is a moment of great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happiness!--This would almost make 
amends for every thing?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward tried to return her kindness 
as it deserved,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but before such witnesses he dared 
not say half what he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">really felt.  Again they all sat down, 
and for a moment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or two all were silent; while Marianne 
was looking with the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">most speaking tenderness, sometimes 
at Edward and sometimes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Elinor, regretting only that their 
delight in each</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other should be checked by Lucy's 
unwelcome presence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward was the first to speak, and 
it was to notice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's altered looks, and express 
his fear of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not finding London agree with her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, don't think of me!&quot;she 
replied with spirited</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">earnestness, though her eyes were 
filled with tears</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she spoke, &quot;don't think of 
MY health.  Elinor is well,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you see.  That must be enough for 
us both.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This remark was not calculated to 
make Edward or</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor more easy, nor to conciliate 
the good will of Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who looked up at Marianne with no 
very benignant expression.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do you like London?&quot; said 
Edward, willing to say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any thing that might introduce another 
subject.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Not at all.  I expected much 
pleasure in it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but I have found none.  The sight 
of you, Edward, is the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only comfort it has afforded; and 
thank Heaven! you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are what you always were!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She paused--no one spoke.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I think, Elinor,&quot; she presently 
added, &quot;we must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">employ Edward to take care of us in 
our return to Barton.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In a week or two, I suppose, we shall 
be going; and, I trust,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward will not be very unwilling 
to accept the charge.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor Edward muttered something, but 
what it was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nobody knew, not even himself.  But 
Marianne, who saw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his agitation, and could easily trace 
it to whatever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cause best pleased herself, was perfectly 
satisfied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and soon talked of something else.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We spent such a day, Edward, 
in Harley Street</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yesterday!  So dull, so wretchedly 
dull!--But I have much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to say to you on that head, which 
cannot be said now.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And with this admirable discretion 
did she defer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the assurance of her finding their 
mutual relatives more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disagreeable than ever, and of her 
being particularly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disgusted with his mother, till they 
were more in private.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But why were you not there, 
Edward?--Why did you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not come?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I was engaged elsewhere.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Engaged!  But what was that, 
when such friends</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were to be met?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps, Miss Marianne,&quot; 
cried Lucy, eager to take</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some revenge on her, &quot;you think 
young men never stand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">upon engagements, if they have no 
mind to keep them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">little as well as great.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was very angry, but Marianne 
seemed entirely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">insensible of the sting; for she calmly 
replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Not so, indeed; for, seriously 
speaking, I am very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sure that conscience only kept Edward 
from Harley Street.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And I really believe he HAS the most 
delicate conscience</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world; the most scrupulous 
in performing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every engagement, however minute, 
and however it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may make against his interest or pleasure.  
He is the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">most fearful of giving pain, of wounding 
expectation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the most incapable of being selfish, 
of any body</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and 
I will say it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What! are you never to hear yourself 
praised!--Then you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be no friend of mine; for those 
who will accept</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of my love and esteem, must submit 
to my open commendation.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The nature of her commendation, in 
the present case,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, happened to be particularly 
ill-suited to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feelings of two thirds of her auditors, 
and was so very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unexhilarating to Edward, that he 
very soon got up to go away.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Going so soon!&quot; said Marianne; 
&quot;my dear Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this must not be.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And drawing him a little aside, she 
whispered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her persuasion that Lucy could not 
stay much longer.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But even this encouragement failed, 
for he would go;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Lucy, who would have outstaid 
him, had his visit lasted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two hours, soon afterwards went away.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What can bring her here so often?&quot; 
said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her leaving them.  &quot;Could 
not she see that we wanted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her gone!--how teazing to Edward!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why so?--we were all his friends, 
and Lucy has been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the longest known to him of any.  
It is but natural</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he should like to see her as 
well as ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne looked at her steadily, and 
said,&quot;You know,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, that this is a kind of talking 
which I cannot bear.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If you only hope to have your assertion 
contradicted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as I must suppose to be the case, 
you ought to recollect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that I am the last person in the world 
to do it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I cannot descend to be tricked out 
of assurances, that are</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not really wanted.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She then left the room; and Elinor 
dared not follow</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her to say more, for bound as she 
was by her promise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of secrecy to Lucy, she could give 
no information that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would convince Marianne; and painful 
as the consequences</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her still continuing in an error 
might be, she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">obliged to submit to it.  All that 
she could hope, was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Edward would not often expose 
her or himself to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">distress of hearing Marianne's mistaken 
warmth, nor to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">repetition of any other part of the 
pain that had attended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their recent meeting--and this she 
had every reason to expect.</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Within a few days after this meeting, 
the newspapers</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">announced to the world, that the lady 
of Thomas Palmer,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Esq. was safely delivered of a son 
and heir; a very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">interesting and satisfactory paragraph, 
at least to all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">those intimate connections who knew 
it before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This event, highly important to Mrs. 
Jennings's happiness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">produced a temporary alteration in 
the disposal of her time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and influenced, in a like degree, 
the engagements</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her young friends; for as she wished 
to be as much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as possible with Charlotte, she went 
thither every morning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as she was dressed, and did 
not return till late</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, 
at the particular</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">request of the Middletons, spent the 
whole of every day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in every day in Conduit Street.  For 
their own comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they would much rather have remained, 
at least all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the morning, in Mrs. Jennings's house; 
but it was not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a thing to be urged against the wishes 
of everybody.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their hours were therefore made over 
to Lady Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the two Miss Steeles, by whom 
their company, in fact</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was as little valued, as it was professedly 
sought.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They had too much sense to be desirable 
companions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the former; and by the latter they 
were considered with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a jealous eye, as intruding on THEIR 
ground, and sharing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the kindness which they wanted to 
monopolize. Though nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could be more polite than Lady Middleton's 
behaviour to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor and Marianne, she did not really 
like them at all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Because they neither flattered herself 
nor her children,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could not believe them good-natured; 
and because they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were fond of reading, she fancied 
them satirical: perhaps</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without exactly knowing what it was 
to be satirical;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but THAT did not signify. It was censure 
in common use,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and easily given.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their presence was a restraint both 
on her and on Lucy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It checked the idleness of one, and 
the business of the other.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Middleton was ashamed of doing 
nothing before them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the flattery which Lucy was proud 
to think of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and administer at other times, she 
feared they would despise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her for offering.  Miss Steele was 
the least discomposed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the three, by their presence; and 
it was in their power</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to reconcile her to it entirely. Would 
either of them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only have given her a full and minute 
account of the whole</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, 
she would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have thought herself amply rewarded 
for the sacrifice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the best place by the fire after 
dinner, which their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">arrival occasioned.  But this conciliation 
was not granted;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for though she often threw out expressions 
of pity for her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister to Elinor, and more than once 
dropt a reflection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the inconstancy of beaux before 
Marianne, no effect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was produced, but a look of indifference 
from the former,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or of disgust in the latter. An effort 
even yet lighter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might have made her their friend.  
Would they only have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">laughed at her about the Doctor!  
But so little were they,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">anymore than the others, inclined 
to oblige her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that if Sir John dined from home, 
she might spend a whole</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">day without hearing any other raillery 
on the subject,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than what she was kind enough to bestow 
on herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">All these jealousies and discontents, 
however, were so</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">totally unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, 
that she thought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it a delightful thing for the girls 
to be together;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and generally congratulated her young 
friends every night,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on having escaped the company of a 
stupid old woman so long.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She joined them sometimes at Sir John's, 
sometimes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at her own house; but wherever it 
was, she always came</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in excellent spirits, full of delight 
and importance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attributing Charlotte's well doing 
to her own care, and ready</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to give so exact, so minute a detail 
of her situation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as only Miss Steele had curiosity 
enough to desire.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One thing DID disturb her; and of 
that she made her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">daily complaint.  Mr. Palmer maintained 
the common,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but unfatherly opinion among his sex, 
of all infants being alike;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and though she could plainly perceive, 
at different times,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the most striking resemblance between 
this baby and every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one of his relations on both sides, 
there was no convincing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his father of it; no persuading him 
to believe that it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not exactly like every other baby 
of the same age;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor could he even be brought to acknowledge 
the simple</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proposition of its being the finest 
child in the world.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I come now to the relation of a misfortune,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which about this time befell Mrs. 
John Dashwood.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It so happened that while her two 
sisters with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings were first calling on 
her in Harley Street,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">another of her acquaintance had dropt 
in--a circumstance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in itself not apparently likely to 
produce evil to her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But while the imaginations of other 
people will carry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them away to form wrong judgments 
of our conduct,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to decide on it by slight appearances, 
one's happiness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must in some measure be always at 
the mercy of chance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In the present instance, this last-arrived 
lady allowed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her fancy to so far outrun truth and 
probability,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that on merely hearing the name of 
the Miss Dashwoods,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood's 
sisters,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she immediately concluded them to 
be staying in Harley Street;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and this misconstruction produced 
within a day</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or two afterwards, cards of invitation 
for them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as well as for their brother and sister, 
to a small</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">musical party at her house. The consequence 
of which was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Mrs. John Dashwood was obliged 
to submit not only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the exceedingly great inconvenience 
of sending her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, 
what was still worse,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be subject to all the unpleasantness 
of appearing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to treat them with attention: and 
who could tell that they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might not expect to go out with her 
a second time?  The power</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of disappointing them, it was true, 
must always be her's.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But that was not enough; for when 
people are determined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on a mode of conduct which they know 
to be wrong, they feel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">injured by the expectation of any 
thing better from them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne had now been brought by degrees, 
so much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into the habit of going out every 
day, that it was become</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a matter of indifference to her, whether 
she went or not:</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she prepared quietly and mechanically 
for every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">evening's engagement, though without 
expecting the smallest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">amusement from any, and very often 
without knowing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">till the last moment, where it was 
to take her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To her dress and appearance she was 
grown so perfectly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indifferent, as not to bestow half 
the consideration on it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">during the whole of her toilet, which 
it received from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Steele in the first five minutes 
of their being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">together, when it was finished.  Nothing 
escaped HER minute</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">observation and general curiosity; 
she saw every thing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and asked every thing; was never easy 
till she knew the price</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of every part of Marianne's dress; 
could have guessed the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">number of her gowns altogether with 
better judgment than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne herself, and was not without 
hopes of finding out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before they parted, how much her washing 
cost per week,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and how much she had every year to 
spend upon herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The impertinence of these kind of 
scrutinies, moreover,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was generally concluded with a compliment, 
which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though meant as its douceur, was considered 
by Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the greatest impertinence of all; 
for after undergoing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an examination into the value and 
make of her gown,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the colour of her shoes, and the arrangement 
of her hair,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was almost sure of being told 
that upon &quot;her word</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she looked vastly smart, and she dared 
to say she would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">make a great many conquests.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With such encouragement as this, was 
she dismissed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the present occasion, to her brother's 
carriage;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which they were ready to enter five 
minutes after it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stopped at the door, a punctuality 
not very agreeable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to their sister-in-law, who had preceded 
them to the house</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her acquaintance, and was there 
hoping for some delay</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on their part that might inconvenience 
either herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or her coachman.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The events of this evening were not 
very remarkable.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The party, like other musical parties, 
comprehended a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great many people who had real taste 
for the performance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a great many more who had none 
at all; and the performers</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">themselves were, as usual, in their 
own estimation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that of their immediate friends, 
the first private</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">performers in England.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As Elinor was neither musical, nor 
affecting to be so,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she made no scruple of turning her 
eyes from the grand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pianoforte, whenever it suited her, 
and unrestrained even</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the presence of a harp, and violoncello, 
would fix</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them at pleasure on any other object 
in the room. In one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of these excursive glances she perceived 
among a group</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of young men, the very he, who had 
given them a lecture</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on toothpick-cases at Gray's.  She 
perceived him soon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">afterwards looking at herself, and 
speaking familiarly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her brother; and had just determined 
to find out his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">name from the latter, when they both 
came towards her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mr. Dashwood introduced him to 
her as Mr. Robert Ferrars.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He addressed her with easy civility, 
and twisted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his head into a bow which assured 
her as plainly as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">words could have done, that he was 
exactly the coxcomb</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had heard him described to be 
by Lucy.  Happy had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it been for her, if her regard for 
Edward had depended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">less on his own merit, than on the 
merit of his nearest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">relations!  For then his brother's 
bow must have given</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the finishing stroke to what the ill-humour 
of his mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sister would have begun.  But 
while she wondered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the difference of the two young 
men, she did not find</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that the emptiness of conceit of the 
one, put her out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all charity with the modesty and 
worth of the other.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Why they WERE different, Robert exclaimed 
to her himself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the course of a quarter of an hour's 
conversation;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for, talking of his brother, and lamenting 
the extreme</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">GAUCHERIE which he really believed 
kept him from mixing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in proper society, he candidly and 
generously attributed it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much less to any natural deficiency, 
than to the misfortune</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a private education; while he himself, 
though probably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without any particular, any material 
superiority</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by nature, merely from the advantage 
of a public school,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was as well fitted to mix in the world 
as any other man.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon my soul,&quot; he added, 
&quot;I believe it is nothing more;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so I often tell my mother, when 
she is grieving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about it.  'My dear Madam,' I always 
say to her, 'you must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">make yourself easy. The evil is now 
irremediable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it has been entirely your own 
doing.  Why would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you be persuaded by my uncle, Sir 
Robert, against your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">own judgment, to place Edward under 
private tuition,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the most critical time of his life?  
If you had only sent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him to Westminster as well as myself, 
instead of sending</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him to Mr. Pratt's, all this would 
have been prevented.'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This is the way in which I always 
consider the matter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and my mother is perfectly convinced 
of her error.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor would not oppose his opinion, 
because,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whatever might be her general estimation 
of the advantage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a public school, she could not 
think of Edward's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">abode in Mr. Pratt's family, with 
any satisfaction.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You reside in Devonshire, I 
think,&quot;--was his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">next observation, &quot;in a cottage 
near Dawlish.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor set him right as to its situation;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it seemed rather surprising to 
him that anybody</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could live in Devonshire, without 
living near Dawlish.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He bestowed his hearty approbation 
however on their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">species of house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;For my own part,&quot; said 
he,&quot;I am excessively fond</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a cottage; there is always so much 
comfort, so much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">elegance about them.  And I protest, 
if I had any money</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to spare, I should buy a little land 
and build one myself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">within a short distance of London, 
where I might drive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself down at any time, and collect 
a few friends</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about me, and be happy.  I advise 
every body who is going</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to build, to build a cottage.  My 
friend Lord Courtland</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">came to me the other day on purpose 
to ask my advice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and laid before me three different 
plans of Bonomi's. </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I was to decide on the best of them.  
'My dear Courtland,'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said I, immediately throwing them 
all into the fire, 'do not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">adopt either of them, but by all means 
build a cottage.'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And that I fancy, will be the end 
of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Some people imagine that there 
can be no accommodations,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no space in a cottage; but this is 
all a mistake.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I was last month at my friend Elliott's, 
near Dartford.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lady Elliott wished to give a dance.  
'But how can it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be done?' said she; 'my dear Ferrars, 
do tell me how it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is to be managed.  There is not a 
room in this cottage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that will hold ten couple, and where 
can the supper be?'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I immediately saw that there could 
be no difficulty in it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so I said, 'My dear Lady Elliott, 
do not be uneasy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The dining parlour will admit eighteen 
couple with ease;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; 
the library</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may be open for tea and other refreshments; 
and let the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">supper be set out in the saloon.'  
Lady Elliott was delighted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the thought.  We measured the 
dining-room, and found</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it would hold exactly eighteen couple, 
and the affair</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was arranged precisely after my plan.  
So that, in fact,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you see, if people do but know how 
to set about it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every comfort may be as well enjoyed 
in a cottage </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as in the most spacious dwelling.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor agreed to it all, for she did 
not think </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he deserved the compliment of rational 
opposition.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As John Dashwood had no more pleasure 
in music than his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">eldest sister, his mind was equally 
at liberty to fix on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any thing else; and a thought struck 
him during the evening,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which he communicated to his wife, 
for her approbation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when they got home.  The consideration 
of Mrs. Dennison's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mistake,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in supposing his sisters their guests, 
had suggested the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">propriety of their being really invited 
to become such,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while Mrs. Jenning's engagements kept 
her from home.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The expense would be nothing, the 
inconvenience not more;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and it was altogether an attention 
which the delicacy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his conscience pointed out to be 
requisite to its</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">complete enfranchisement from his 
promise to his father.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fanny was startled at the proposal.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not see how it can be done,&quot; 
said she,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;without affronting Lady Middleton, 
for they spend every day</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with her; otherwise I should be exceedingly 
glad to do it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You know I am always ready to pay 
them any attention</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in my power, as my taking them out 
this evening shews.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But they are Lady Middleton's visitors.  
How can I ask them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">away from her?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her husband, but with great humility, 
did not see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the force of her objection.  &quot;They 
had already spent a week</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in this manner in Conduit Street, 
and Lady Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not be displeased at their giving 
the same number</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of days to such near relations.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fanny paused a moment, and then, with 
fresh vigor, said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My love I would ask them with 
all my heart, if it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was in my power.  But I had just settled 
within myself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a 
few days with us.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They are very well behaved, good kind 
of girls; and I think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the attention is due to them, as their 
uncle did so very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well by Edward.  We can ask your sisters 
some other year,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know; but the Miss Steeles may 
not be in town any more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure you will like them; indeed, 
you DO like them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know, very much already, and so 
does my mother; and they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are such favourites with Harry!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Dashwood was convinced.  He saw 
the necessity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of inviting the Miss Steeles immediately, 
and his conscience</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was pacified by the resolution of 
inviting his sisters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">another year; at the same time, however, 
slyly suspecting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that another year would make the invitation 
needless,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by bringing Elinor to town as Colonel 
Brandon's wife,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne as THEIR visitor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fanny, rejoicing in her escape, and 
proud of the ready</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wit that had procured it, wrote the 
next morning to Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to request her company and her sister's, 
for some days,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Harley Street, as soon as Lady 
Middleton could spare them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This was enough to make Lucy really 
and reasonably happy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working 
for her, herself;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cherishing all her hopes, and promoting 
all her views! </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Such an opportunity of being with 
Edward and his family was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">above all things, the most material 
to her interest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and such an invitation the most gratifying 
to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feelings!  It was an advantage that 
could not be too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily 
made use of;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the visit to Lady Middleton, which 
had not before had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any precise limits, was instantly 
discovered to have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">always meant to end in two days' time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When the note was shown to Elinor, 
as it was within ten</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">minutes after its arrival, it gave 
her, for the first time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some share in the expectations of 
Lucy; for such a mark</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed on 
so short an acquaintance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed to declare that the good-will 
towards her arose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from something more than merely malice 
against herself;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and might be brought, by time and 
address, to do</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every thing that Lucy wished.  Her 
flattery had already</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subdued the pride of Lady Middleton, 
and made an entry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into the close heart of Mrs. John 
Dashwood; and these</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were effects that laid open the probability 
of greater.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Miss Steeles removed to Harley 
Street, and all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that reached Elinor of their influence 
there, strengthened</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her expectation of the event.  Sir 
John, who called on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them more than once, brought home 
such accounts of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">favour they were in, as must be universally 
striking.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood had never been so much 
pleased with any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">young women in her life, as she was 
with them; had given</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">each of them a needle book made by 
some emigrant;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">called Lucy by her Christian name; 
and did not know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whether she should ever be able to 
part with them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 37</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end 
of a fortnight,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that her mother felt it no longer 
necessary to give up</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the whole of her time to her; and, 
contenting herself with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">visiting her once or twice a day, 
returned from that period</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her own home, and her own habits, 
in which she found</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the Miss Dashwoods very ready to ressume 
their former share.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">About the third or fourth morning 
after their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being thus resettled in Berkeley Street, 
Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on returning from her ordinary visit 
to Mrs. Palmer,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entered the drawing-room, where Elinor 
was sitting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by herself, with an air of such hurrying 
importance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as prepared her to hear something 
wonderful; and giving her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time only to form that idea, began 
directly to justify it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by saying,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! 
have you heard the news?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, ma'am.  What is it?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Something so strange!  But you 
shall hear it all.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When I got to Mr. Palmer's, I found 
Charlotte quite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a fuss about the child.  She was 
sure it was very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ill--it cried, and fretted, and was 
all over pimples.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! 
my dear,'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">says I, 'it is nothing in the world, 
but the red gum--'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and nurse said just the same.  But 
Charlotte, she would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was 
sent for; and luckily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he happened to just come in from Harley 
Street, so he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stepped over directly, and as soon 
as ever he saw the child,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be said just as we did, that it was 
nothing in the world</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the red gum, and then Charlotte 
was easy.  And so,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">just as he was going away again, it 
came into my head,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure I do not know how I happened 
to think of it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it came into my head to ask him 
if there was any news.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">So upon that, he smirked, and simpered, 
and looked grave,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and seemed to know something or other, 
and at last he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said in a whisper, 'For fear any unpleasant 
report</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should reach the young ladies under 
your care as to their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister's indisposition, I think it 
advisable to say,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that I believe there is no great reason 
for alarm; I hope</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood will do very well.'&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What! is Fanny ill?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is exactly what I said, 
my dear. 'Lord!' says I,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it 
all came out; and the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">long and the short of the matter, 
by all I can learn,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seems to be this.  Mr. Edward Ferrars, 
the very young</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">man I used to joke with you about 
(but however, as it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">turns out, I am monstrous glad there 
was never any thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, 
has been engaged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">above this twelvemonth to my cousin 
Lucy!--There's for you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my dear!--And not a creature knowing 
a syllable of the matter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">except Nancy!--Could you have believed 
such a thing possible?--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">There is no great wonder in their 
liking one another;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but that matters should be brought 
so forward between them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and nobody suspect it!--THAT is strange!--I 
never happened</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see them together, or I am sure 
I should have found it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out directly. Well, and so this was 
kept a great secret,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither 
she nor your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">brother or sister suspected a word 
of the matter;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">till this very morning, poor Nancy, 
who, you know, is a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well-meaning creature, but no conjurer, 
popt it all out.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they 
are all so fond</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Lucy, to be sure they will make 
no difficulty about it;'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so, away she went to your sister, 
who was sitting all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">alone at her carpet-work, little suspecting 
what was to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">come--for she had just been saying 
to your brother, only five</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">minutes before, that she thought to 
make a match between</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward and some Lord's daughter or 
other, I forget who.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">So you may think what a blow it was 
to all her vanity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and pride.  She fell into violent 
hysterics immediately,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with such screams as reached your 
brother's ears,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as he was sitting in his own dressing-room 
down stairs,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thinking about writing a letter to 
his steward in the country.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">So up he flew directly, and a terrible 
scene took place,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Lucy was come to them by that 
time, little dreaming</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what was going on.  Poor soul!  I 
pity HER. And I must say,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I think she was used very hardly; 
for your sister scolded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">like any fury, and soon drove her 
into a fainting fit.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and 
cried bitterly;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and your brother, he walked about 
the room, and said</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he did not know what to do.  Mrs. 
Dashwood declared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they should not stay a minute longer 
in the house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and your brother was forced to go 
down upon HIS knees too,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to persuade her to let them stay till 
they had packed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">up their clothes.  THEN she fell into 
hysterics again,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he was so frightened that he would 
send for Mr. Donavan,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mr. Donavan found the house in 
all this uproar.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The carriage was at the door ready 
to take my poor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cousins away, and they were just stepping 
in as he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">came off; poor Lucy in such a condition, 
he says,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could hardly walk; and Nancy, 
she was almost as bad.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I declare, I have no patience with 
your sister; and I hope,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with all my heart, it will be a match 
in spite of her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward 
will be in when he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hears of it! To have his love used 
so scornfully! for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they say he is monstrous fond of her, 
as well he may.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I should not wonder, if he was to 
be in the greatest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">passion!--and Mr. Donavan thinks just 
the same.  He and I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had a great deal of talk about it; 
and the best of all is,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he is gone back again to Harley 
Street, that he may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is 
told of it, for she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was sent for as soon as ever my cousins 
left the house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for your sister was sure SHE would 
be in hysterics too;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so she may, for what I care.  
I have no pity for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">either of them.  I have no notion 
of people's making</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such a to-do about money and greatness. There 
is no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reason on earth why Mr. Edward and 
Lucy should not marry;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford 
to do very well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by her son, and though Lucy has next 
to nothing herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she knows better than any body how 
to make the most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. 
Ferrars would only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">allow him five hundred a-year, she 
would make as good</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an appearance with it as any body 
else would with eight.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lord! how snug they might live in 
such another cottage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as yours--or a little bigger--with 
two maids, and two men;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I believe I could help them to 
a housemaid, for my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Betty has a sister out of place, that 
would fit them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exactly.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as 
Elinor had had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time enough to collect her thoughts, 
she was able</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to give such an answer, and make such 
observations,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the subject might naturally be 
supposed to produce.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Happy to find that she was not suspected 
of any extraordinary</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">interest in it; that Mrs. Jennings 
(as she had of late</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">often hoped might be the case) had 
ceased to imagine her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at all attached to Edward; and happy 
above all the rest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the absence of Marianne, she felt 
very well able</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to speak of the affair without embarrassment, 
and to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">give her judgment, as she believed, 
with impartiality</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the conduct of every one concerned 
in it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She could hardly determine what her 
own expectation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of its event really was; though she 
earnestly tried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to drive away the notion of its being 
possible to end</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">otherwise at last, than in the marriage 
of Edward and Lucy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, 
though there could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not be a doubt of its nature, she 
was anxious to hear;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and still more anxious to know how 
Edward would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conduct himself.  For HIM she felt 
much compassion;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Lucy very little--and it cost 
her some pains to procure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that little;--for the rest of the 
party none at all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no 
other subject,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing 
Marianne for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its discussion.  No time was to be 
lost in undeceiving her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in making her acquainted with the 
real truth, and in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">endeavouring to bring her to hear 
it talked of by others,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without betraying that she felt any 
uneasiness for her sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or any resentment against Edward.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's office was a painful one.--She 
was going</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to remove what she really believed 
to be her sister's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">chief consolation,--to give such particulars 
of Edward as she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feared would ruin him for ever in 
her good opinion,-and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make Marianne, by a resemblance 
in their situations,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which to HER fancy would seem strong, 
feel all her own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disappointment over again.  But unwelcome 
as such a task</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be, it was necessary to be done, 
and Elinor therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hastened to perform it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was very far from wishing to dwell 
on her own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feelings, or to represent herself 
as suffering much,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any otherwise than as the self-command 
she had practised</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">since her first knowledge of Edward's 
engagement, might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suggest a hint of what was practicable 
to Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her narration was clear and simple; 
and though it could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not be given without emotion, it was 
not accompanied</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by violent agitation, nor impetuous 
grief.--THAT belonged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rather to the hearer, for Marianne 
listened with horror,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and cried excessively.  Elinor was 
to be the comforter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of others in her own distresses, no 
less than in theirs;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and all the comfort that could be 
given by assurances</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her own composure of mind, and 
a very earnest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">vindication of Edward from every charge 
but of imprudence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was readily offered.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Marianne for some time would give 
credit to neither.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward seemed a second Willoughby; 
and acknowledging</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as Elinor did, that she HAD loved 
him most sincerely,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could she feel less than herself!  
As for Lucy Steele,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she considered her so totally unamiable, 
so absolutely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">incapable of attaching a sensible 
man, that she could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not be persuaded at first to believe, 
and afterwards</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to pardon, any former affection of 
Edward for her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She would not even admit it to have 
been natural;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor left her to be convinced 
that it was so,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by that which only could convince 
her, a better knowledge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of mankind.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her first communication had reached 
no farther than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to state the fact of the engagement, 
and the length of time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it had existed.--Marianne's feelings 
had then broken in,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and put an end to all regularity of 
detail; and for some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time all that could be done was to 
soothe her distress,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lessen her alarms, and combat her 
resentment.  The first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">question on her side, which led to 
farther particulars,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How long has this been known 
to you, Elinor? has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he written to you?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have known it these four months.  
When Lucy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">first came to Barton Park last November, 
she told me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in confidence of her engagement.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At these words, Marianne's eyes expressed 
the astonishment </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which her lips could not utter.  After 
a pause of wonder, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she exclaimed--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Four months!--Have you known 
of this four months?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor confirmed it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What!--while attending me in 
all my misery, has this </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been on your heart?--And I have reproached 
you for being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happy!&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It was not fit that you should 
then know how much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I was the reverse!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Four months!&quot;--cried Marianne 
again.--&quot;So calm!--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so cheerful!--how have you been supported?&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;By feeling that I was doing 
my duty.--My promise to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy, obliged me to be secret.  I 
owed it to her, therefore,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to avoid giving any hint of the truth; 
and I owed it to my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">family and friends, not to create 
in them a solicitude about me, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which it could not be in my power 
to satisfy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne seemed much struck.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have very often wished to 
undeceive yourself and my </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother,&quot; added Elinor; &quot;and 
once or twice I have attempted it;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but without betraying my trust, I 
never could have convinced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Four months!--and yet you loved 
him!&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes. But I did not love only 
him;--and while the comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of others was dear to me, I was glad 
to spare them from knowing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how much I felt.  Now, I can think 
and speak of it with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">little emotion.  I would not have 
you suffer on my account;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I assure you I no longer suffer 
materially myself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have many things to support me.  
I am not conscious of having</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">provoked the disappointment by any 
imprudence of my own,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have borne it as much as possible 
without spreading</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it farther.  I acquit Edward of essential 
misconduct.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I wish him very happy; and I am so 
sure of his always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">doing his duty, that though now he 
may harbour some regret,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the end he must become so.  Lucy 
does not want sense,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that is the foundation on which 
every thing good may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be built.--And after all, Marianne, 
after all that is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bewitching in the idea of a single 
and constant attachment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and all that can be said of one's 
happiness depending</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entirely on any particular person, 
it is not meant--it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is not fit--it is not possible that 
it should be so.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward will marry Lucy; he will marry 
a woman superior</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in person and understanding to half 
her sex; and time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and habit will teach him to forget 
that he ever thought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">another superior to HER.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If such is your way of thinking,&quot; 
said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;if the loss of what is most 
valued is so easily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be made up by something else, your 
resolution,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your self-command, are, perhaps, a 
little less to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wondered at.--They are brought more 
within my comprehension.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I understand you.--You do not 
suppose that I have ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">felt much.--For four months, Marianne, 
I have had all this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hanging on my mind, without being 
at liberty to speak</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it to a single creature; knowing 
that it would make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you and my mother most unhappy whenever 
it were explained</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to you, yet unable to prepare you 
for it in the least.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was told me,--it was in a manner 
forced on me by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very person herself, whose prior engagement 
ruined all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my prospects; and told me, as I thought, 
with triumph.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This person's suspicions, therefore, 
I have had to oppose,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by endeavouring to appear indifferent 
where I have been most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">deeply interested;--and it has not 
been only once;--I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had her hopes and exultation to listen 
to again and again.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have known myself to be divided 
from Edward for ever,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without hearing one circumstance that 
could make me less</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">desire the connection.--Nothing has 
proved him unworthy;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor has anything declared him indifferent 
to me.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have had to contend against the 
unkindness of his sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the insolence of his mother; and 
have suffered the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">punishment of an attachment, without 
enjoying its advantages.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And all this has been going on at 
a time, when, as you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know too well, it has not been my 
only unhappiness.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If you can think me capable of ever 
feeling--surely you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may suppose that I have suffered NOW.  
The composure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of mind with which I have brought 
myself at present</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to consider the matter, the consolation 
that I have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">willing to admit, have been the effect 
of constant and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">painful exertion;--they did not spring 
up of themselves;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they did not occur to relieve my spirits 
at first.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No, Marianne.--THEN, if I had not 
been bound to silence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perhaps nothing could have kept me 
entirely--not even what I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">owed to my dearest friends--from openly 
shewing that I was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">VERY unhappy.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was quite subdued.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! Elinor,&quot; she cried, 
&quot;you have made me hate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself for ever.--How barbarous have 
I been to you!--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you, who have been my only comfort, 
who have borne with me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in all my misery, who have seemed 
to be only suffering</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for me!--Is this my gratitude?--Is 
this the only return I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can make you?--Because your merit 
cries out upon myself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have been trying to do it away.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The tenderest caresses followed this 
confession.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In such a frame of mind as she was 
now in, Elinor had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no difficulty in obtaining from her 
whatever promise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she required; and at her request, 
Marianne engaged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never to speak of the affair to any 
one with the least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">appearance of bitterness;--to meet 
Lucy without betraying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the smallest increase of dislike to 
her;--and even to see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward himself, if chance should bring 
them together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without any diminution of her usual 
cordiality.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">These were great concessions;--but 
where Marianne felt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she had injured, no reparation 
could be too much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her to make.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She performed her promise of being 
discreet,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to admiration.--She attended to all 
that Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had to say upon the subject, with 
an unchanging complexion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dissented from her in nothing, and 
was heard three</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">times to say, &quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;--She 
listened to her praise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Lucy with only moving from one 
chair to another,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and when Mrs. Jennings talked of Edward's 
affection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it cost her only a spasm in her throat.--Such 
advances</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">towards heroism in her sister, made 
Elinor feel equal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to any thing herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The next morning brought a farther 
trial of it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a visit from their brother, who 
came with a most serious</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">aspect to talk over the dreadful affair, 
and bring them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">news of his wife.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You have heard, I suppose,&quot; 
said he with great solemnity, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as he was seated,&quot;of 
the very shocking discovery </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that took place under our roof yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They all looked their assent; it seemed 
too awful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a moment for speech.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your sister,&quot; he continued, 
&quot;has suffered dreadfully.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars too--in short it has 
been a scene of such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">complicated distress--but I will hope 
that the storm may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be weathered without our being any 
of us quite overcome.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor Fanny! she was in hysterics all 
yesterday.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I would not alarm you too much.  
Donavan says there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is nothing materially to be apprehended; 
her constitution</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is a good one, and her resolution 
equal to any thing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She has borne it all, with the fortitude 
of an angel!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She says she never shall think well 
of anybody again;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and one cannot wonder at it, after 
being so deceived!--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">meeting with such ingratitude, where 
so much kindness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been shewn, so much confidence 
had been placed!  It</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was quite out of the benevolence of 
her heart, that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had asked these young women to her 
house; merely because</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she thought they deserved some attention, 
were harmless,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well-behaved girls, and would be pleasant 
companions;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for otherwise we both wished very 
much to have invited you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne to be with us, while 
your kind friend there,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was attending her daughter.  And now 
to be so rewarded!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">'I wish, with all my heart,' says 
poor Fanny in her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affectionate way, 'that we had asked 
your sisters instead</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of them.'&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Here he stopped to be thanked; which 
being done,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he went on.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, 
when first Fanny</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">broke it to her, is not to be described.  
While she with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the truest affection had been planning 
a most eligible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">connection for him, was it to be supposed 
that he could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be all the time secretly engaged to 
another person!--such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a suspicion could never have entered 
her head!  If she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suspected ANY prepossession elsewhere, 
it could not be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in THAT quarter.  'THERE, to be sure,' 
said she, 'I might</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have thought myself safe.' She was 
quite in an agony.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">We consulted together, however, as 
to what should be done,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and at last she determined to send 
for Edward.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He came.  But I am sorry to relate 
what ensued.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to 
make him put an end</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the engagement, assisted too as 
you may well suppose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, 
was of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no avail.  Duty, affection, every 
thing was disregarded.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I never thought Edward so stubborn, 
so unfeeling before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His mother explained to him her liberal 
designs, in case</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his marrying Miss Morton; told 
him she would settle on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him the Norfolk estate, which, clear 
of land-tax, brings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a good thousand a-year; offered 
even, when matters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">grew desperate, to make it twelve 
hundred; and in opposition</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to this, if he still persisted in 
this low connection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">represented to him the certain penury 
that must attend</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the match.  His own two thousand pounds 
she protested</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should be his all; she would never 
see him again; and so far</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would she be from affording him the 
smallest assistance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that if he were to enter into any 
profession with a view</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of better support, she would do all 
in her power to prevent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him advancing in it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">clapped her hands together, and cried, 
&quot;Gracious God!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can this be possible!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well may you wonder, Marianne,&quot; 
replied her brother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;at the obstinacy which could 
resist such arguments as these.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Your exclamation is very natural.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was going to retort, but 
she remembered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her promises, and forbore.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;All this, however,&quot; he 
continued, &quot;was urged in vain.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward said very little; but what 
he did say, was in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the most determined manner.  Nothing 
should prevail on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him to give up his engagement.  He 
would stand to it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cost him what it might.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Then,&quot; cried Mrs. Jennings 
with blunt sincerity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no longer able to be silent, &quot;he 
has acted like an honest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">man! I beg your pardon, Mr. Dashwood, 
but if he had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">done otherwise, I should have thought 
him a rascal.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have some little concern in the 
business, as well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as yourself, for Lucy Steele is my 
cousin, and I believe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there is not a better kind of girl 
in the world, nor one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who more deserves a good husband.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">John Dashwood was greatly astonished; 
but his nature</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was calm, not open to provocation, 
and he never wished</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to offend anybody, especially anybody 
of good fortune.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He therefore replied, without any 
resentment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I would by no means speak disrespectfully 
of any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">relation of yours, madam.  Miss Lucy 
Steele is, I dare say,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a very deserving young woman, but 
in the present case</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know, the connection must be impossible.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And to have entered into a secret 
engagement with a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">young man under her uncle's care, 
the son of a woman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">especially of such very large fortune 
as Mrs. Ferrars,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. 
In short, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I do not mean to reflect upon the 
behaviour of any person </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whom you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings.  
We all wish </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her extremely happy; and Mrs. Ferrars's 
conduct throughout </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the whole, has been such as every 
conscientious, good mother, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in like circumstances, would adopt.  
It has been dignified</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and liberal.  Edward has drawn his 
own lot, and I fear </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it will be a bad one.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne sighed out her similar apprehension;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor's heart wrung for the feelings 
of Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while braving his mother's threats, 
for a woman who could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not reward him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Mrs. Jennings,&quot;and 
how did it end?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am sorry to say, ma'am, in 
a most unhappy rupture:--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward is dismissed for ever from 
his mother's notice.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He left her house yesterday, but where 
he is gone, or whether</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he is still in town, I do not know; 
for WE of course can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">make no inquiry.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Poor young man!--and what is 
to become of him?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What, indeed, ma'am!  It is 
a melancholy consideration.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Born to the prospect of such affluence!  
I cannot conceive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a situation more deplorable.  The 
interest of two thousand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pounds--how can a man live on it?--and 
when to that is added</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the recollection, that he might, but 
for his own folly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">within three months have been in the 
receipt of two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thousand, five hundred a-year (for 
Miss Morton has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thirty thousand pounds,) I cannot 
picture to myself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a more wretched condition. We must 
all feel for him;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the more so, because it is totally 
out of our power</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to assist him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Poor young man!&quot; cried 
Mrs. Jennings, &quot;I am sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he should be very welcome to bed and 
board at my house;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so I would tell him if I could 
see him.  It is not fit</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he should be living about at 
his own charge now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at lodgings and taverns.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's heart thanked her for such 
kindness towards Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though she could not forbear smiling 
at the form of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If he would only have done as 
well by himself,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said John Dashwood,&quot;as all his 
friends were disposed to do</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by him, he might now have been in 
his proper situation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and would have wanted for nothing.  
But as it is, it must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be out of anybody's power to assist 
him.  And there is one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thing more preparing against him, 
which must be worse than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all--his mother has determined, with 
a very natural kind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of spirit, to settle THAT estate upon 
Robert immediately,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which might have been Edward's, on 
proper conditions.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I left her this morning with her lawyer, 
talking over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the business.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well!&quot; said Mrs. Jennings, 
&quot;that is HER revenge.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Everybody has a way of their own.  
But I don't think mine</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would be, to make one son independent, 
because another had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">plagued me.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne got up and walked about the 
room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Can anything be more galling 
to the spirit of a man,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">continued John,&quot;than to see his 
younger brother in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possession of an estate which might 
have been his own?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor Edward! I feel for him sincerely.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A few minutes more spent in the same 
kind of effusion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">concluded his visit; and with repeated 
assurances to his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sisters that he really believed there 
was no material</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">danger in Fanny's indisposition, and 
that they need</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not therefore be very uneasy about 
it, he went away;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">leaving the three ladies unanimous 
in their sentiments</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the present occasion, as far at 
least as it regarded</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars's conduct, the Dashwoods', 
and Edward's.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's indignation burst forth 
as soon as he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quitted the room; and as her vehemence 
made reserve</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary 
in Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they all joined in a very spirited 
critique upon the party.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 38</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her 
praise of Edward's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conduct, but only Elinor and Marianne 
understood its</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">true merit.  THEY only knew how little 
he had had to tempt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him to be disobedient, and how small 
was the consolation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beyond the consciousness of doing 
right, that could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">remain to him in the loss of friends 
and fortune.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor gloried in his integrity; and 
Marianne forgave all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his offences in compassion for his 
punishment.  But though</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">confidence between them was, by this 
public discovery,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">restored to its proper state, it was 
not a subject on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which either of them were fond of 
dwelling when alone.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor avoided it upon principle, 
as tending to fix still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more upon her thoughts, by the too 
warm, too positive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">assurances of Marianne, that belief 
of Edward's continued</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection for herself which she rather 
wished to do away;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne's courage soon failed 
her, in trying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to converse upon a topic which always 
left her more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dissatisfied with herself than ever, 
by the comparison</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it necessarily produced between Elinor's 
conduct and her own.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She felt all the force of that comparison; 
but not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as her sister had hoped, to urge her 
to exertion now;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she felt it with all the pain of continual 
self-reproach,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">regretted most bitterly that she had 
never exerted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself before; but it brought only 
the torture of penitence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without the hope of amendment.  Her 
mind was so much weakened</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she still fancied present exertion 
impossible,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and therefore it only dispirited her 
more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nothing new was heard by them, for 
a day or two afterwards,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of affairs in Harley Street, or Bartlett's 
Buildings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But though so much of the matter was 
known to them already,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Mrs. Jennings might have had 
enough to do in spreading</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that knowledge farther, without seeking 
after more,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had resolved from the first to 
pay a visit of comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and inquiry to her cousins as soon 
as she could;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and nothing but the hindrance of more 
visitors than usual,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had prevented her going to them within 
that time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The third day succeeding their knowledge 
of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">particulars, was so fine, so beautiful 
a Sunday as to draw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">many to Kensington Gardens, though 
it was only the second</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">week in March.  Mrs. Jennings and 
Elinor were of the number;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Marianne, who knew that the Willoughbys 
were again</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in town, and had a constant dread 
of meeting them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">chose rather to stay at home, than 
venture into so public</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a place.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings 
joined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them soon after they entered the Gardens, 
and Elinor was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not sorry that by her continuing with 
them, and engaging</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, 
she was herself left</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to quiet reflection.  She saw nothing 
of the Willoughbys,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing of Edward, and for some time 
nothing of anybody</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who could by any chance whether grave 
or gay, be interesting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her.  But at last she found herself 
with some surprise,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">accosted by Miss Steele, who, though 
looking rather shy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expressed great satisfaction in meeting 
them, and on receiving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">encouragement from the particular 
kindness of Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">left her own party for a short time, 
to join their's.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered 
to Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Get it all out of her, my dear.  
She will tell you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any thing if you ask.  You see I cannot 
leave Mrs. Clarke.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was lucky, however, for Mrs. Jennings's 
curiosity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor's too, that she would tell 
any thing WITHOUT</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being asked; for nothing would otherwise 
have been learnt.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am so glad to meet you;&quot; 
said Miss Steele,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">taking her familiarly by the arm--&quot;for 
I wanted to see you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all things in the world.&quot;  
And then lowering her voice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I suppose Mrs. Jennings has 
heard all about it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Is she angry?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Not at all, I believe, with 
you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;That is a good thing.  And Lady 
Middleton, is SHE angry?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I cannot suppose it possible 
that she should.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am monstrous glad of it.  
Good gracious!  I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had such a time of it!  I never saw 
Lucy in such a rage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in my life.  She vowed at first she 
would never trim me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">up a new bonnet, nor do any thing 
else for me again,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so long as she lived; but now she 
is quite come to,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and we are as good friends as ever.  
Look, she made me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this bow to my hat, and put in the 
feather last night.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">There now, YOU are going to laugh 
at me too.  But why</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should not I wear pink ribbons?  I 
do not care if it IS</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the Doctor's favourite colour. I am 
sure, for my part,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I should never have known he DID like 
it better than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any other colour, if he had not happened 
to say so.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My cousins have been so plaguing me!  
I declare sometimes </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I do not know which way to look before 
them.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She had wandered away to a subject 
on which Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had nothing to say, and therefore 
soon judged it expedient</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to find her way back again to the 
first.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, but Miss Dashwood,&quot;speaking 
triumphantly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;people may say what they chuse 
about Mr. Ferrars's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">declaring he would not have Lucy, 
for it is no such thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I can tell you; and it is quite a 
shame for such ill-natured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reports to be spread abroad.  Whatever 
Lucy might think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about it herself, you know, it was 
no business of other</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">people to set it down for certain.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I never heard any thing of the 
kind hinted at before,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I assure you,&quot; said Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, did not you?  But it WAS 
said, I know, very well,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and by more than one; for Miss Godby 
told Miss Sparks,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that nobody in their senses could 
expect Mr. Ferrars</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to give up a woman like Miss Morton, 
with thirty thousand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele 
that had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing at all; and I had it from 
Miss Sparks myself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And besides that, my cousin Richard 
said himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that when it came to the point he 
was afraid Mr. Ferrars</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would be off; and when Edward did 
not come near us</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for three days, I could not tell what 
to think myself;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I believe in my heart Lucy gave 
it up all for lost;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for we came away from your brother's 
Wednesday,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and we saw nothing of him not all 
Thursday, Friday,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Saturday, and did not know what 
was become of him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Once Lucy thought to write to him, 
but then her spirits</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rose against that.  However this morning 
he came just</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as we came home from church; and then 
it all came out,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how he had been sent for Wednesday 
to Harley Street,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and been talked to by his mother and 
all of them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and how he had declared before them 
all that he loved</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy 
would he have.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And how he had been so worried by 
what passed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that as soon as he had went away from 
his mother's house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he had got upon his horse, and rid 
into the country,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some where or other; and how he had 
stayed about at an inn</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all Thursday and Friday, on purpose 
to get the better</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it.  And after thinking it all 
over and over again,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he said, it seemed to him as if, now 
he had no fortune,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and no nothing at all, it would be 
quite unkind to keep</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her on to the engagement, because 
it must be for her loss,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for he had nothing but two thousand 
pounds, and no hope</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of any thing else; and if he was to 
go into orders,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as he had some thoughts, he could 
get nothing but a curacy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and how was they to live upon that?--He 
could not bear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to think of her doing no better, and 
so he begged,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if she had the least mind for it, 
to put an end to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">matter directly, and leave him shift 
for himself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I heard him say all this as plain 
as could possibly be.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And it was entirely for HER sake, 
and upon HER account,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he said a word about being off, 
and not upon his own.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I will take my oath he never dropt 
a syllable of being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tired of her, or of wishing to marry 
Miss Morton, or any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thing like it.  But, to be sure, Lucy 
would not give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ear to such kind of talking; so she 
told him directly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">(with a great deal about sweet and 
love, you know,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and all that--Oh, la! one can't repeat 
such kind of things</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know)--she told him directly, 
she had not the least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mind in the world to be off, for she 
could live with him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">upon a trifle, and how little so ever 
he might have,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she should be very glad to have it 
all, you know,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or something of the kind.  So then 
he was monstrous happy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and talked on some time about what 
they should do,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and they agreed he should take orders 
directly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and they must wait to be married till 
he got a living.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And just then I could not hear any 
more, for my cousin</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">called from below to tell me Mrs. 
Richardson was come in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her coach, and would take one of us 
to Kensington Gardens;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so I was forced to go into the room 
and interrupt them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to ask Lucy if she would like to go, 
but she did not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">care to leave Edward; so I just run 
up stairs and put</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on a pair of silk stockings and came 
off with the Richardsons.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not understand what you 
mean by interrupting them,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Elinor; &quot;you were all in 
the same room together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were not you?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, indeed, not us.  La! Miss 
Dashwood, do you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think people make love when any body 
else is by? Oh,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for shame!--To be sure you must know 
better than that.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">(Laughing affectedly.)--No, no; they 
were shut up in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">drawing-room together, and all I heard 
was only by listening</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the door.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How!&quot;cried Elinor; &quot;have 
you been repeating to me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what you only learnt yourself by listening 
at the door?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sorry I did not know it before; 
for I certainly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would not have suffered you to give 
me particulars of a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conversation which you ought not to 
have known yourself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">How could you behave so unfairly by 
your sister?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, la! there is nothing in 
THAT.  I only stood at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the door, and heard what I could.  
And I am sure Lucy would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have done just the same by me; for 
a year or two back,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when Martha Sharpe and I had so many 
secrets together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she never made any bones of hiding 
in a closet, or behind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a chimney-board, on purpose to hear 
what we said.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor tried to talk of something 
else; but Miss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Steele could not be kept beyond a 
couple of minutes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from what was uppermost in her mind.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Edward talks of going to Oxford 
soon,&quot; said she;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;but now he is lodging at No. 
--, Pall Mall.  What an </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ill-natured woman his monther is, 
an't she? And your </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">brother and sister were not very kind! 
However, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I shan't say anything against them 
to YOU; and to be sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they did send us home in their own 
chariot, which </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was more than I looked for.  And for 
my part, I was all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a fright for fear your sister should 
ask us for the </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">huswifes she had gave us a day or 
two before; but, however, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing was said about them, and I 
took care to keep mine </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out of sight.  Edward have got some 
business at Oxford,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he says; so he must go there for a 
time; and after THAT, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as he can light upon a Bishop, 
he will be ordained. </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I wonder what curacy he will get!--Good 
gracious! </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">(giggling as she spoke) I'd lay my 
life I know what </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my cousins will say, when they hear 
of it.  They will </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tell me I should write to the Doctor, 
to get Edward </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the curacy of his new living. I know 
they will; but I am </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sure I would not do such a thing for 
all the world.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">'La!' I shall say directly, 'I wonder 
how you could think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of such a thing?  I write to the Doctor, 
indeed!'&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;it 
is a comfort to be prepared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against the worst.  You have got your 
answer ready.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Steele was going to reply on 
the same subject,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the approach of her own party 
made another more necessary.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, la! here come the Richardsons.  
I had a vast deal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more to say to you, but I must not 
stay away from them not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any longer.  I assure you they are 
very genteel people.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He makes a monstrous deal of money, 
and they keep their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">own coach.  I have not time to speak 
to Mrs. Jennings about</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it myself, but pray tell her I am 
quite happy to hear she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is not in anger against us, and Lady 
Middleton the same;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if anything should happen to take 
you and your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister away, and Mrs. Jennings should 
want company,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sure we should be very glad to 
come and stay with her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for as long a time as she likes. I 
suppose Lady Middleton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">won't ask us any more this bout.  
Good-by; I am sorry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Marianne was not here.  Remember 
me kindly to her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">La! if you have not got your spotted 
muslin on!--I wonder</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you was not afraid of its being torn.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Such was her parting concern; for 
after this, she had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time only to pay her farewell compliments 
to Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before her company was claimed by 
Mrs. Richardson;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor was left in possession 
of knowledge which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might feed her powers of reflection 
some time, though she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had learnt very little more than what 
had been already</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">foreseen and foreplanned in her own 
mind.  Edward's marriage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with Lucy was as firmly determined 
on, and the time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of its taking place remained as absolutely 
uncertain,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she had concluded it would be;--every 
thing depended,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exactly after her expectation, on 
his getting that preferment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of which, at present, there seemed 
not the smallest chance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As soon as they returned to the carriage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings was eager for information; 
but as Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wished to spread as little as possible 
intelligence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that had in the first place been so 
unfairly obtained,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she confined herself to the brief 
repetition of such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">simple particulars, as she felt assured 
that Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the sake of her own consequence, 
would choose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to have known. The continuance of 
their engagement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the means that were able to be 
taken for promoting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its end, was all her communication; 
and this produced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from Mrs. Jennings the following natural 
remark.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Wait for his having a living!--ay, 
we all know how</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">THAT will end:--they will wait a twelvemonth, 
and finding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no good comes of it, will set down 
upon a curacy of fifty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pounds a-year, with the interest of 
his two thousand pounds,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and what little matter Mr. Steele 
and Mr. Pratt can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">give her.--Then they will have a child 
every year! and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lord help 'em! how poor they will 
be!--I must see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what I can give them towards furnishing 
their house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Two maids and two men, indeed!--as 
I talked of t'other </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">day.--No, no, they must get a stout 
girl of all works.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Betty's sister would never do for 
them NOW.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The next morning brought Elinor a 
letter by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two-penny post from Lucy herself. It 
was as follows:</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                    &quot;Bartlett's 
Building, March.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;I hope my dear Miss Dashwood 
will excuse the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     liberty I take of writing to 
her; but I know your</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    friendship for me will make you 
pleased to hear such</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     a good account of myself and 
my dear Edward, after</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     all the troubles we have went 
through lately,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    therefore will make no more apologies, 
but proceed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     to say that, thank God! though 
we have suffered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     dreadfully, we are both quite 
well now, and as happy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    as we must always be in one another's 
love.  We have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     had great trials, and great persecutions, 
but</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     however, at the same time, gratefully 
acknowledge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     many friends, yourself not the 
least among them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     whose great kindness I shall 
always thankfully</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    remember, as will Edward too, 
who I have told of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     it. I am sure you will be glad 
to hear, as likewise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     dear Mrs. Jennings, I spent two 
happy hours with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     him yesterday afternoon, he would 
not hear of our</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    parting, though earnestly did 
I, as I thought my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     duty required, urge him to it 
for prudence sake,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     and would have parted for ever 
on the spot, would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    he consent to it; but he said 
it should never be,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     he did not regard his mother's 
anger, while he could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     have my affections; our prospects 
are not very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     bright, to be sure, but we must 
wait, and hope for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     the best; he will be ordained 
shortly; and should</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     it ever be in your power to recommend 
him to any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    body that has a living to bestow, 
am very sure you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     will not forget us, and dear 
Mrs. Jennings too,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     trust she will speak a good word 
for us to Sir John,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    or Mr. Palmer, or any friend that 
may be able to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     assist us.--Poor Anne was much 
to blame for what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     she did, but she did it for the 
best, so I say</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    nothing; hope Mrs. Jennings won't 
think it too much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     trouble to give us a call, should 
she come this way</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     any morning, 'twould be a great 
kindness, and my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    cousins would be proud to know 
her.--My paper reminds</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     me to conclude; and begging to 
be most gratefully</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     and respectfully remembered to 
her, and to Sir John,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    and Lady Middleton, and the dear 
children, when you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     chance to see them, and love 
to Miss Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                                      
&quot;I am,&amp;c.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As soon as Elinor had finished it, 
she performed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what she concluded to be its writer's 
real design,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by placing it in the hands of Mrs. 
Jennings, who read it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">aloud with many comments of satisfaction 
and praise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Very well indeed!--how prettily 
she writes!--aye,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that was quite proper to let him be 
off if he would.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">That was just like Lucy.--Poor soul! 
I wish I COULD get</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him a living, with all my heart.--She 
calls me dear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings, you see.  She is a 
good-hearted girl</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as ever lived.--Very well upon my 
word.  That sentence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is very prettily turned. Yes, yes, 
I will go and see her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sure enough.  How attentive she is, 
to think of every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">body!--Thank you, my dear, for shewing 
it me.  It is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as pretty a letter as ever I saw, 
and does Lucy's head</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and heart great credit.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 39</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather 
more than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two months in town, and Marianne's 
impatience to be gone</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">increased every day.  She sighed for 
the air, the liberty,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the quiet of the country; and fancied 
that if any place</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could give her ease, Barton must do 
it. Elinor was hardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">less anxious than herself for their 
removal, and only so much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">less bent on its being effected immediately, 
as that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was conscious of the difficulties 
of so long a journey,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which Marianne could not be brought 
to acknowledge.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She began, however, seriously to turn 
her thoughts towards</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its accomplishment, and had already 
mentioned their wishes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to their kind hostess, who resisted 
them with all the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">eloquence of her good-will, when a 
plan was suggested,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which, though detaining them from 
home yet a few weeks </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">longer, appeared to Elinor altogether 
much more eligible </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than any other. The Palmers were to 
remove to Cleveland </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about the end of March, for the Easter 
holidays;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Jennings, with both her friends, 
received a very </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">warm invitation from Charlotte to 
go with them. This would </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not, in itself, have been sufficient 
for the delicacy of </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood;--but it was inforced 
with so much real </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">politeness by Mr. Palmer himself, 
as, joined to the very </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great amendment of his manners towards 
them since her </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister had been known to be unhappy, 
induced her to accept </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it with pleasure.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When she told Marianne what she had 
done, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her first reply was not very auspicious.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Cleveland!&quot;--she cried, 
with great agitation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, I cannot go to Cleveland.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You forget,&quot; said Elinor 
gently,&quot;that its situation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is not...that it is not in the neighbourhood 
of...&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But it is in Somersetshire.--I 
cannot go</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into Somersetshire.--There, where 
I looked forward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to going...No, Elinor, you cannot 
expect me to go there.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor would not argue upon the propriety 
of overcoming</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such feelings;--she only endeavoured 
to counteract them by</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">working on others;--represented it, 
therefore, as a measure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which would fix the time of her returning 
to that dear mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whom she so much wished to see, in 
a more eligible,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more comfortable manner, than any 
other plan could do,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and perhaps without any greater delay.  
From Cleveland,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which was within a few miles of Bristol, 
the distance to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Barton was not beyond one day, though 
a long day's journey;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and their mother's servant might easily 
come there to attend</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them down; and as there could be no 
occasion of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">staying above a week at Cleveland, 
they might now be at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">home in little more than three weeks' 
time.  As Marianne's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection for her mother was sincere, 
it must triumph</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with little difficulty, over the imaginary 
evils she had started.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings was so far from being 
weary of her guest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she pressed them very earnestly 
to return with her again</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from Cleveland. Elinor was grateful 
for the attention,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it could not alter her design; 
and their mother's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">concurrence being readily gained, 
every thing relative</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to their return was arranged as far 
as it could be;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne found some relief in 
drawing up a statement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the hours that were yet to divide 
her from Barton.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ah! Colonel, I do not know what 
you and I shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">do without the Miss Dashwoods;&quot;--was 
Mrs. Jennings's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">address to him when he first called 
on her, after their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">leaving her was settled--&quot;for 
they are quite resolved</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">upon going home from the Palmers;--and 
how forlorn we</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shall be, when I come back!--Lord! 
we shall sit and gape</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at one another as dull as two cats.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, 
by this vigorous</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sketch of their future ennui, to provoke 
him to make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that offer, which might give himself 
an escape from it;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if so, she had soon afterwards 
good reason to think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her object gained; for, on Elinor's 
moving to the window</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to take more expeditiously the dimensions 
of a print,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which she was going to copy for her 
friend, he followed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her to it with a look of particular 
meaning, and conversed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with her there for several minutes.  
The effect of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">discourse on the lady too, could not 
escape her observation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for though she was too honorable to 
listen, and had even</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">changed her seat, on purpose that 
she might NOT hear,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to one close by the piano forte on 
which Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was playing, she could not keep herself 
from seeing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Elinor changed colour, attended 
with agitation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and was too intent on what he said 
to pursue her employment.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Still farther in confirmation of her 
hopes, in the interval</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Marianne's turning from one lesson 
to another,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some words of the Colonel's inevitably 
reached her ear,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in which he seemed to be apologising 
for the badness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his house. This set the matter 
beyond a doubt.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She wondered, indeed, at his thinking 
it necessary</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to do so; but supposed it to be the 
proper etiquette.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What Elinor said in reply she could 
not distinguish,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but judged from the motion of her 
lips, that she did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not think THAT any material objection;--and 
Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">commended her in her heart for being 
so honest.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They then talked on for a few minutes 
longer without her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">catching a syllable, when another 
lucky stop in Marianne's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">performance brought her these words 
in the Colonel's calm voice,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am afraid it cannot take place 
very soon.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like 
a speech,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was almost ready to cry out, &quot;Lord! 
what should </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hinder it?&quot;--but checking her 
desire, confined herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to this silent ejaculation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;This is very strange!--sure 
he need not wait to be older.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This delay on the Colonel's side, 
however, did not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seem to offend or mortify his fair 
companion in the least,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for on their breaking up the conference 
soon afterwards,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings 
very plainly heard</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor say, and with a voice which 
shewed her to feel what she said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I shall always think myself 
very much obliged to you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her 
gratitude,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and only wondered that after hearing 
such a sentence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the Colonel should be able to take 
leave of them, as he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately did, with the utmost sang-froid, 
and go away</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without making her any reply!--She 
had not thought her old</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">friend could have made so indifferent 
a suitor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What had really passed between them 
was to this effect.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have heard,&quot; said he, 
with great compassion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;of the injustice your friend 
Mr. Ferrars has suffered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from his family; for if I understand 
the matter right,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he has been entirely cast off by them 
for persevering</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his engagement with a very deserving 
young woman.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Have I been rightly informed?--Is 
it so?--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor told him that it was.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty,&quot;--he 
replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with great feeling,--&quot;of dividing, 
or attempting to divide,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two young people long attached to 
each other, is terrible.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she 
may be doing--what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she may drive her son to.  I have 
seen Mr. Ferrars two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or three times in Harley Street, and 
am much pleased</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with him.  He is not a young man with 
whom one can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be intimately acquainted in a short 
time, but I have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seen enough of him to wish him well 
for his own sake,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as a friend of yours, I wish it 
still more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I understand that he intends to take 
orders.  Will you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be so good as to tell him that the 
living of Delaford,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now just vacant, as I am informed 
by this day's post, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is his, if he think it worth his acceptance--but 
THAT, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perhaps, so unfortunately circumstanced 
as he is now, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it may be  nonsense to appear to doubt; 
I only wish it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were more  valuable.-- It is a rectory, 
but a small one; </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the late incumbent, I believe, did 
not make more than </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">200 L per annum, and though it is 
certainly capable </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of improvement, I fear, not to such 
an amount as </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to afford him a very comfortable income.  
Such as it is,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, my pleasure in presenting 
him to it, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will be very great.  Pray assure him 
of it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's astonishment at this commission 
could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hardly have been greater, had the 
Colonel been really</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">making her an offer of his hand.  
The preferment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which only two days before she had 
considered as hopeless</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Edward, was already provided to 
enable him to marry;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and SHE, of all people in the world, 
was fixed on to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bestow it!--Her emotion was such as 
Mrs. Jennings had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attributed to a very different cause;--but 
whatever minor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feelings less pure, less pleasing, 
might have a share</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in that emotion, her esteem for the 
general benevolence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her gratitude for the particular 
friendship,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which together prompted Colonel Brandon 
to this act,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were strongly felt, and warmly expressed. She 
thanked him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for it with all her heart, spoke of 
Edward's principles and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disposition with that praise which 
she knew them to deserve;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and promised to undertake the commission 
with pleasure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if it were really his wish to put 
off so agreeable an office</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to another.  But at the same time, 
she could not help</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thinking that no one could so well 
perform it as himself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was an office in short, from which, 
unwilling to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward the pain of receiving an obligation 
from HER,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she would have been very glad to be 
spared herself;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Colonel Brandon, on motives of 
equal delicacy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">declining it likewise, still seemed 
so desirous of its being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">given through her means, that she 
would not on any account</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">make farther opposition.  Edward, 
she believed, was still in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">town,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and fortunately she had heard his 
address from Miss Steele.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She could undertake therefore to inform 
him of it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the course of the day.  After this 
had been settled,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon began to talk of his 
own advantage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in securing so respectable and agreeable 
a neighbour,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and THEN it was that he mentioned 
with regret, that the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">house was small and indifferent;--an 
evil which Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as Mrs. Jennings had supposed her 
to do, made very light of,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at least as far as regarded its size.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The smallness of the house,&quot; 
said she,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I cannot imagine any inconvenience 
to them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for it will be in proportion to their 
family and income.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">By which the Colonel was surprised 
to find that SHE</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was considering Mr. Ferrars's marriage 
as the certain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">consequence of the presentation; for 
he did not suppose it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">possible that Delaford living could 
supply such an income,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as anybody in his style of life would 
venture to settle on--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he said so.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;This little rectory CAN do no 
more than make Mr. Ferrars</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comfortable as a bachelor; it cannot 
enable him to marry.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am sorry to say that my patronage 
ends with this;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and my interest is hardly more extensive.  
If, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by an unforeseen chance it should 
be in my power to serve</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him farther, I must think very differently 
of him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from what I now do, if I am not as 
ready to be useful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to him then as I sincerely wish I 
could be at present.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What I am now doing indeed, seems 
nothing at all,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">since it can advance him so little 
towards what must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be his principal, his only object 
of happiness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His marriage must still be a distant 
good;--at least,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am afraid it cannot take place very 
soon.--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Such was the sentence which, when 
misunderstood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so justly offended the delicate feelings 
of Mrs. Jennings;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but after this narration of what really 
passed between</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while 
they stood at the window,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the gratitude expressed by the latter 
on their parting, may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perhaps appear in general, not less 
reasonably excited,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor less properly worded than if it 
had arisen from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an offer of marriage.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 40</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, Miss Dashwood,&quot; said 
Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sagaciously smiling, as soon as the 
gentleman had withdrawn,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not ask you what the Colonel 
has been saying to you;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for though, upon my honour, I TRIED 
to keep out of hearing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I could not help catching enough to 
understand his business.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And I assure you I never was better 
pleased in my life,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I wish you joy of it with all 
my heart.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Thank you, ma'am,&quot; said 
Elinor.  &quot;It is a matter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of great joy to me; and I feel the 
goodness of Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon most sensibly.  There are 
not many men who would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">act as he has done.  Few people who 
have so compassionate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a heart! I never was more astonished 
in my life.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Lord! my dear, you are very 
modest.  I an't the least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">astonished at it in the world, for 
I have often thought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of late, there was nothing more likely 
to happen.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You judged from your knowledge 
of the Colonel's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">general benevolence; but at least 
you could not foresee</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that the opportunity would so very 
soon occur.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Opportunity!&quot; repeated 
Mrs. Jennings--&quot;Oh! as to that,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when a man has once made up his mind 
to such a thing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">somehow or other he will soon find 
an opportunity.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Well, my dear, I wish you joy of it 
again and again;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if ever there was a happy couple 
in the world, I think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I shall soon know where to look for 
them.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You mean to go to Delaford after 
them I suppose,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Elinor, with a faint smile.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Aye, my dear, that I do, indeed.  
And as to the house</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being a bad one, I do not know what 
the Colonel would be at,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for it is as good a one as ever I 
saw.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He spoke of its being out of 
repair.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, and whose fault is that? 
why don't he repair it?--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who should do it but himself?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were interrupted by the servant's 
coming in to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">announce the carriage being at the 
door; and Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately preparing to go, said,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, my dear, I must be gone 
before I have had half</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my talk out.  But, however, we may 
have it all over in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the evening; for we shall be quite 
alone.  I do not ask</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you to go with me, for I dare say 
your mind is too full</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the matter to care for company; 
and besides, you must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">long to tell your sister all about 
it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne had left the room before 
the conversation began.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly, ma'am, I shall tell 
Marianne of it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but I shall not mention it at present 
to any body else.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! very well,&quot; said Mrs. 
Jennings rather disappointed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Then you would not have me tell 
it to Lucy, for I think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of going as far as Holborn to-day.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, ma'am, not even Lucy if 
you please.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One day's delay will not be very material; 
and till I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have written to Mr. Ferrars, I think 
it ought not to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mentioned to any body else.  I shall 
do THAT directly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It is of importance that no time should 
be lost with him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for he will of course have much to 
do relative to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his ordination.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This speech at first puzzled Mrs. 
Jennings exceedingly.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Why Mr. Ferrars was to have been written 
to about it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in such a hurry, she could not immediately 
comprehend.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A few moments' reflection, however, 
produced a very happy idea,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she exclaimed;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh, ho!--I understand you.  
Mr. Ferrars is to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the man.  Well, so much the better 
for him.  Ay, to be sure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he must be ordained in readiness; 
and I am very glad</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to find things are so forward between 
you.  But, my dear,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is not this rather out of character?  
Should not the Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">write himself?--sure, he is the proper 
person.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor did not quite understand the 
beginning of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings's speech, neither did 
she think it worth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inquiring into; and therefore only 
replied to its conclusion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Colonel Brandon is so delicate 
a man, that he rather</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wished any one to announce his intentions 
to Mr. Ferrars</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than himself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And so YOU are forced to do 
it.  Well THAT is an odd</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">kind of delicacy!  However, I will 
not disturb you (seeing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her preparing to write.) You know 
your own concerns best.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">So goodby, my dear.  I have not heard 
of any thing to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">please me so well since Charlotte 
was brought to bed.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And away she went; but returning again 
in a moment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have just been thinking of 
Betty's sister, my dear.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I should be very glad to get her so 
good a mistress.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But whether she would do for a lady's 
maid, I am sure I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">can't tell.  She is an excellent housemaid, 
and works</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very well at her needle.  However, 
you will think of all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that at your leisure.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly, ma'am,&quot; replied 
Elinor, not hearing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much of what she said, and more anxious 
to be alone,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than to be mistress of the subject.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">How she should begin--how she should 
express</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself in her note to Edward, was 
now all her concern.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The particular circumstances between 
them made</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a difficulty of that which to any 
other person would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been the easiest thing in the 
world; but she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">equally feared to say too much or 
too little, and sat</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">deliberating over her paper, with 
the pen in her band,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">till broken in on by the entrance 
of Edward himself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He had met Mrs. Jennings at the door 
in her way to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the carriage, as he came to leave 
his farewell card; and she,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after apologising for not returning 
herself, had obliged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him to enter, by saying that Miss 
Dashwood was above,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and wanted to speak with him on very 
particular business.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor had just been congratulating 
herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the midst of her perplexity, that 
however difficult it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might be to express herself properly 
by letter, it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at least preferable to giving the 
information by word</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of mouth, when her visitor entered, 
to force her upon this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">greatest exertion of all.  Her astonishment 
and confusion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were very great on his so sudden appearance.  
She had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not seen him before since his engagement 
became public,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and therefore not since his knowing 
her to be acquainted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with it; which, with the consciousness 
of what she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been thinking of, and what she 
had to tell him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made her feel particularly uncomfortable 
for some minutes.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He too was much distressed; and they 
sat down together</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a most promising state of embarrassment.--Whether 
he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had asked her pardon for his intrusion 
on first coming</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into the room, he could not recollect; 
but determining</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be on the safe side, he made his 
apology in form</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as he could say any thing, 
after taking a chair.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mrs. Jennings told me,&quot; 
said he, &quot;that you wished</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to speak with me, at least I understood 
her so--or I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">certainly should not have intruded 
on you in such a manner;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though at the same time, I should 
have been extremely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sorry to leave London without seeing 
you and your sister;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">especially as it will most likely 
be some time--it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is not probable that I should soon 
have the pleasure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of meeting you again. I go to Oxford 
tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You would not have gone, however,&quot; 
said Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">recovering herself, and determined 
to get over what she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so much dreaded as soon as possible, 
&quot;without receiving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">our good wishes, even if we had not 
been able to give them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in person.  Mrs. Jennings was quite 
right in what she said.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have something of consequence to 
inform you of,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which I was on the point of communicating 
by paper.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am charged with a most agreeable 
office (breathing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rather faster than usual as she spoke.)  
Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who was here only ten minutes ago, 
has desired me to say,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that understanding you mean to take 
orders, he has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great pleasure in offering you the 
living of Delaford</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now just vacant, and only wishes it 
were more valuable.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Allow me to congratulate you on having 
so respectable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and well-judging a friend, and to 
join in his wish that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the living--it is about two hundred 
a-year--were much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more considerable, and such as might 
better enable you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to--as might be more than a temporary 
accommodation to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yourself--such, in short, as might 
establish all your views</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of happiness.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What Edward felt, as he could not 
say it himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it cannot be expected that any one 
else should say for him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He LOOKED all the astonishment which 
such unexpected,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such unthought-of information could 
not fail of exciting;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but he said only these two words,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Colonel Brandon!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes,&quot; continued Elinor, 
gathering more resolution,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as some of the worst was over, &quot;Colonel 
Brandon means</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it as a testimony of his concern for 
what has lately</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">passed--for the cruel situation in 
which the unjustifiable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conduct of your family has placed 
you--a concern</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which I am sure Marianne, myself, 
and all your friends,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must share; and likewise as a proof 
of his high esteem</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for your general character, and his 
particular approbation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of your behaviour on the present occasion.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Colonel Brandon give ME a living!--Can 
it be possible?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The unkindness of your own relations 
has made you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">astonished to find friendship any 
where.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No,&quot;replied be, with sudden 
consciousness, &quot;not to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">find it in YOU; for I cannot be ignorant 
that to you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to your goodness, I owe it all.--I 
feel it--I would express</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it if I could--but, as you well know, 
I am no orator.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are very much mistaken.  
I do assure you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that you owe it entirely, at least 
almost entirely,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to your own merit, and Colonel Brandon's 
discernment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it.  I have had no hand in it.  
I did not even know,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">till I understood his design, that 
the living was vacant;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor had it ever occurred to me that 
he might have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had such a living in his gift.  As 
a friend of mine,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of my family, he may, perhaps--indeed 
I know he HAS,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">still greater pleasure in bestowing 
it; but, upon my word,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you owe nothing to my solicitation.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Truth obliged her to acknowledge some 
small share</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the action, but she was at the 
same time so unwilling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to appear as the benefactress of Edward, 
that she acknowledged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it with hesitation; which probably 
contributed to fix</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that suspicion in his mind which had 
recently entered it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">For a short time he sat deep in thought, 
after Elinor had ceased</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to speak;--at last, and as if it were 
rather an effort, he said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Colonel Brandon seems a man 
of great worth and respectability.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have always heard him spoken of 
as such, and your brother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I know esteems him highly. He is undoubtedly 
a sensible man,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in his manners perfectly the gentleman.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Indeed,&quot; replied Elinor, 
&quot;I believe that you will find him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on farther acquaintance, all that 
you have heard him to be,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as you will be such very near 
neighbours (for I understand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the parsonage is almost close to the 
mansion-house,)</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it is particularly important that 
he SHOULD be all this.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward made no answer; but when she 
had turned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">away her head, gave her a look so 
serious, so earnest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so uncheerful, as seemed to say, that 
he might hereafter wish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the distance between the parsonage 
and the mansion-house</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much greater.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Colonel Brandon, I think, lodges 
in St. James Street,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said he, soon afterwards, rising from 
his chair.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor told him the number of the 
house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I must hurry away then, to give 
him those thanks</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which you will not allow me to give 
YOU; to assure him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he has made me a very--an exceedingly 
happy man.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor did not offer to detain him; 
and they parted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a very earnest assurance on HER 
side of her unceasing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good wishes for his happiness in every 
change of situation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that might befall him; on HIS, with 
rather an attempt to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">return the same good will, than the 
power of expressing it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;When I see him again,&quot; 
said Elinor to herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the door shut him out, &quot;I 
shall see him the husband</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Lucy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And with this pleasing anticipation, 
she sat down</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to reconsider the past, recall the 
words and endeavour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to comprehend all the feelings of 
Edward; and, of course,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to reflect on her own with discontent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When Mrs. Jennings came home, though 
she returned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from seeing people whom she had never 
seen before,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and of whom therefore she must have 
a great deal to say,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her mind was so much more occupied 
by the important secret</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her possession, than by anything 
else, that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reverted to it again as soon as Elinor 
appeared.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, my dear,&quot; she cried, 
&quot;I sent you up to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">young man.  Did not I do right?--And 
I suppose you had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no great difficulty--You did not find 
him very unwilling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to accept your proposal?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, ma'am; THAT was not very 
likely.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, and how soon will he be 
ready?--For it seems</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all to depend upon that.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Really,&quot; said Elinor, &quot;I 
know so little of these kind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture 
as to the time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or the preparation necessary; but 
I suppose two or three</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">months will complete his ordination.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Two or three months!&quot; cried 
Mrs. Jennings; &quot;Lord! my dear,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how calmly you talk of it; and can 
the Colonel wait two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or three months! Lord bless me!--I 
am sure it would put ME</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite out of patience!--And though 
one would be very glad</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to do a kindness by poor Mr. Ferrars, 
I do think it is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not worth while to wait two or three 
months for him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sure somebody else might be found 
that would do as well;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">somebody that is in orders already.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My dear ma'am,&quot; said Elinor, 
&quot;what can you be thinking of?-- </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Why, Colonel Brandon's only object 
is to be of use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Lord bless you, my dear!--Sure 
you do not mean to persuade </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me that the Colonel only marries you 
for the sake of giving </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ten guineas to Mr. Ferrars!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The deception could not continue after 
this;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and an explanation immediately took 
place, by which both</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gained considerable amusement for 
the moment, without any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">material loss of happiness to either, 
for Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only exchanged one form of delight 
for another, and still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without forfeiting her expectation 
of the first.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Aye, aye, the parsonage is but 
a small one,&quot; said she,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after the first ebullition of surprise 
and satisfaction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was over, &quot;and very likely MAY 
be out of repair; but to hear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a man apologising, as I thought, for 
a house that to my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">knowledge has five sitting rooms on 
the ground-floor, and I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think the housekeeper told me could 
make up fifteen beds!--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to you too, that had been used 
to live in Barton cottage!--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It seems quite ridiculous.  But, my 
dear, we must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">touch up the Colonel to do some thing 
to the parsonage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and make it comfortable for them, 
before Lucy goes to it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But Colonel Brandon does not 
seem to have any idea</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the living's being enough to allow 
them to marry.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The Colonel is a ninny, my dear; 
because he has two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thousand a-year himself, he thinks 
that nobody else can marry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on less.  Take my word for it, that, 
if I am alive, I shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be paying a visit at Delaford Parsonage 
before Michaelmas;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I am sure I sha'nt go if Lucy 
an't there.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was quite of her opinion, as 
to the probability</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their not waiting for any thing 
more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 41</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward, having carried his thanks 
to Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">proceeded with his happiness to Lucy; 
and such was the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">excess of it by the time he reached 
Bartlett's Buildings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she was able to assure Mrs. Jennings, 
who called</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her again the next day with her 
congratulations,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she had never seen him in such 
spirits before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her life.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her own happiness, and her own spirits, 
were at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">least very certain; and she joined 
Mrs. Jennings most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">heartily in her expectation of their 
being all comfortably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">together in Delaford Parsonage before 
Michaelmas.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">So far was she, at the same time, 
from any backwardness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to give Elinor that credit which Edward 
WOULD give her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she spoke of her friendship for 
them both with the most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">grateful warmth, was ready to own 
all their obligation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her, and openly declared that no 
exertion for their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good on Miss Dashwood's part, either 
present or future,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would ever surprise her, for she believed 
her capable of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">doing any thing in the world for those 
she really valued.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As for Colonel Brandon, she was not 
only ready to worship</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him as a saint, but was moreover truly 
anxious that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he should be treated as one in all 
worldly concerns;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">anxious that his tithes should be 
raised to the utmost;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and scarcely resolved to avail herself, 
at Delaford,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as far as she possibly could, of his 
servants, his carriage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his cows, and his poultry.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was now above a week since John 
Dashwood had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">called in Berkeley Street, and as 
since that time no notice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been taken by them of his wife's 
indisposition,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor 
began to feel it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">necessary to pay her a visit.--This 
was an obligation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, which not only opposed her 
own inclination,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but which had not the assistance of 
any encouragement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from her companions. Marianne, not 
contented with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">absolutely refusing to go herself, 
was very urgent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to prevent her sister's going at all; 
and Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though her carriage was always at 
Elinor's service,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood, 
that not even her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">curiosity to see how she looked after 
the late discovery,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor her strong desire to affront her 
by taking Edward's part,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could overcome her unwillingness to 
be in her company again.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The consequence was, that Elinor set 
out by herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to pay a visit, for which no one could 
really have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">less inclination, and to run the risk 
of a tete-a-tete</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a woman, whom neither of the 
others had so much </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reason to dislike.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before 
the carriage could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">turn from the house, her husband accidentally 
came out.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He expressed great pleasure in meeting 
Elinor, told her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he had been just going to call 
in Berkeley Street,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and, assuring her that Fanny would 
be very glad to see her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">invited her to come in.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.--Nobody 
was there.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Fanny is in her own room, I 
suppose,&quot; said he:--&quot;I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will go to her presently, for I am 
sure she will not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have the least objection in the world 
to seeing YOU.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Very far from it, indeed. NOW especially 
there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cannot be--but however, you and Marianne 
were always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">great favourites.--Why would not Marianne 
come?&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor made what excuse she could 
for her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am not sorry to see you alone,&quot; 
he replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;for I have a good deal to say 
to you.  This living</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Colonel Brandon's--can it be true?--has 
he really given</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it to Edward?--I heard it yesterday 
by chance, and was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">coming to you on purpose to enquire 
farther about it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is perfectly true.--Colonel 
Brandon has given</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the living of Delaford to Edward.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Really!--Well, this is very 
astonishing!--no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">relationship!--no connection between 
them!--and now</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that livings fetch such a price!--what 
was the value of this?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;About two hundred a year.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Very well--and for the next 
presentation to a living</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of that value--supposing the late 
incumbent to have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been old and sickly, and likely to 
vacate it soon--he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might have got I dare say--fourteen 
hundred pounds.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And how came he not to have settled 
that matter before this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">person's death?--NOW indeed it would 
be too late to sell it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but a man of Colonel Brandon's sense!--I 
wonder he should</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be so improvident in a point of such 
common, such natural,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">concern!--Well, I am convinced that 
there is a vast deal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of inconsistency in almost every human 
character.  I suppose,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however--on recollection--that the 
case may probably be THIS.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward is only to hold the living 
till the person to whom</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the Colonel has really sold the presentation, 
is old enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to take it.--Aye, aye, that is the 
fact, depend upon it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor contradicted it, however, very 
positively;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and by relating that she had herself 
been employed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in conveying the offer from Colonel 
Brandon to Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and, therefore, must understand the 
terms on which it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was given, obliged him to submit to 
her authority.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is truly astonishing!&quot;--he 
cried, after hearing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what she said--&quot;what could be 
the Colonel's motive?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;A very simple one--to be of 
use to Mr. Ferrars.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, well; whatever Colonel 
Brandon may be,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward is a very lucky man.--You will 
not mention the matter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Fanny, however, for though I have 
broke it to her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she bears it vastly well,--she 
will not like to hear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it much talked of.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor had some difficulty here to 
refrain from observing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she thought Fanny might have 
borne with composure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an acquisition of wealth to her brother, 
by which neither</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she nor her child could be possibly 
impoverished.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mrs. Ferrars,&quot; added he, 
lowering his voice to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tone becoming so important a subject, 
&quot;knows nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">about it at present, and I believe 
it will be best to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">keep it entirely concealed from her 
as long as may be.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When the marriage takes place, I fear 
she must hear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it all.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But why should such precaution 
be used?--Though</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it is not to be supposed that Mrs. 
Ferrars can have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the smallest satisfaction in knowing 
that her son has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">money enough to live upon,--for THAT 
must be quite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out of the question; yet why, upon 
her late behaviour,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is she supposed to feel at all?--She 
has done with her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">son, she cast him off for ever, and 
has made all those</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">over whom she had any influence, cast 
him off likewise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Surely, after doing so, she cannot 
be imagined liable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to any impression of sorrow or of 
joy on his account--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she cannot be interested in any thing 
that befalls him.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She would not be so weak as to throw 
away the comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a child, and yet retain the anxiety 
of a parent!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ah! Elinor,&quot; said John, 
&quot;your reasoning is very good,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it is founded on ignorance of 
human nature.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When Edward's unhappy match takes 
place, depend upon it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his mother will feel as much as if 
she had never discarded him;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and, therefore every circumstance 
that may accelerate that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dreadful event, must be concealed 
from her as much as possible.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that 
Edward is her son.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You surprise me; I should think 
it must nearly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have escaped her memory by THIS time.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You wrong her exceedingly.  
Mrs. Ferrars is one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the most affectionate mothers in 
the world.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was silent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We think NOW,&quot;--said Mr. 
Dashwood, after a short pause,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;of ROBERT'S marrying Miss Morton.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive 
importance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her brother's tone, calmly replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The lady, I suppose, has no 
choice in the affair.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Choice!--how do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I only mean that I suppose, 
from your manner</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of speaking, it must be the same to 
Miss Morton whether</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she marry Edward or Robert.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Certainly, there can be no difference; 
for Robert</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will now to all intents and purposes 
be considered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the eldest son;--and as to any 
thing else, they are</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">both very agreeable young men: I do 
not know that one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is superior to the other.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor said no more, and John was 
also for a short</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time silent.--His reflections ended 
thus.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Of ONE thing, my dear sister,&quot; 
kindly taking her hand,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and speaking in an awful whisper,--&quot;I 
may assure you;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I WILL do it, because I know it 
must gratify you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have good reason to think--indeed 
I have it from the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">best authority, or I should not repeat 
it, for otherwise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it would be very wrong to say any 
thing about it--but</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have it from the very best authority--not 
that I ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say it 
herself--but her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">daughter DID, and I have it from her--That 
in short,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whatever objections there might be 
against a certain--a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">certain connection--you understand 
me--it would have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">far preferable to her, it would not 
have given her half</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the vexation that THIS does.  I was 
exceedingly pleased</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered 
it in that light--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a very gratifying circumstance you 
know to us all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">'It would have been beyond comparison,' 
she said, 'the least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">evil of the two, and she would be 
glad to compound NOW</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for nothing worse.' But however, all 
that is quite out</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the question--not to be thought 
of or mentioned--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as to any attachment you know--it 
never could be--all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that is gone by.  But I thought I 
would just tell you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of this, because I knew how much it 
must please you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Not that you have any reason to regret, 
my dear Elinor.  There</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is no doubt of your doing exceedingly 
well--quite as well,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or better, perhaps, all things considered.  
Has Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon been with you lately?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor had heard enough, if not to 
gratify her vanity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and raise her self-importance, to 
agitate her nerves</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and fill her mind;--and she was therefore 
glad to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spared from the necessity of saying 
much in reply herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and from the danger of hearing any 
thing more from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her brother, by the entrance of Mr. 
Robert Ferrars.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After a few moments' chat, John Dashwood, 
recollecting that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister's 
being there,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quitted the room in quest of her; 
and Elinor was left</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to improve her acquaintance with Robert, 
who, by the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gay unconcern, the happy self-complacency 
of his manner</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while enjoying so unfair a division 
of his mother's love</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and liberality, to the prejudice of 
his banished brother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">earned only by his own dissipated 
course of life, and that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">brother's integrity, was confirming 
her most unfavourable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opinion of his head and heart.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They had scarcely been two minutes 
by themselves,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before he began to speak of Edward; 
for he, too, had heard</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the living, and was very inquisitive 
on the subject.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor repeated the particulars of 
it, as she had given them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to John; and their effect on Robert, 
though very different,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not less striking than it had 
been on HIM. He laughed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">most immoderately. The idea of Edward's 
being a clergyman,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and living in a small parsonage-house, 
diverted him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beyond measure;--and when to that 
was added the fanciful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">imagery of Edward reading prayers 
in a white surplice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and publishing the banns of marriage 
between John Smith and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mary Brown, he could conceive nothing 
more ridiculous.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, while she waited in silence 
and immovable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gravity, the conclusion of such folly, 
could not restrain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her eyes from being fixed on him with 
a look that spoke</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all the contempt it excited.  It was 
a look, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very well bestowed, for it relieved 
her own feelings, and gave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no intelligence to him.  He was recalled 
from wit to wisdom,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not by any reproof of her's, but by 
his own sensibility.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We may treat it as a joke,&quot; 
said he, at last,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">recovering from the affected laugh 
which had considerably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lengthened out the genuine gaiety 
of the moment--&quot;but, upon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my soul, it is a most serious business.  
Poor Edward!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he is ruined for ever.  I am extremely 
sorry for it--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I know him to be a very good-hearted 
creature; as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well-meaning a fellow perhaps, as 
any in the world.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You must not judge of him, Miss Dashwood, 
from YOUR</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">slight acquaintance.--Poor Edward!--His 
manners are certainly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not the happiest in nature.--But we 
are not all born,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know, with the same powers,--the 
same address.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor fellow!--to see him in a circle 
of strangers!--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be sure it was pitiable enough!--but 
upon my soul,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I believe he has as good a heart as 
any in the kingdom;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I declare and protest to you I 
never was so shocked in my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">life, as when it all burst forth. I 
could not believe it.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My mother was the first person who 
told me of it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I, feeling myself called on to 
act with resolution,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately said to her, 'My dear 
madam, I do not know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what you may intend to do on the occasion, 
but as for myself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I must say, that if Edward does marry 
this young woman,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I never will see him again.' That 
was what I said immediately.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!--Poor 
Edward!--he has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">done for himself completely--shut 
himself out for ever from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all decent society!--but, as I directly 
said to my mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I am not in the least surprised at 
it; from his style</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of education, it was always to be 
expected.  My poor mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was half frantic.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Have you ever seen the lady?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes; once, while she was staying 
in this house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I happened to drop in for ten minutes; 
and I saw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite enough of her. The merest awkward 
country girl,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without style, or elegance, and almost 
without beauty.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I remember her perfectly.  Just the 
kind of girl I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should suppose likely to captivate 
poor Edward.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I offered immediately, as soon as 
my mother related</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the affair to me, to talk to him myself, 
and dissuade</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him from the match; but it was too 
late THEN, I found,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to do any thing, for unluckily, I 
was not in the way</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at first, and knew nothing of it till 
after the breach</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had taken place, when it was not for 
me, you know,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to interfere.  But had I been informed 
of it a few</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hours earlier--I think it is most 
probable--that something</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might have been hit on.  I certainly 
should have represented</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it to Edward in a very strong light.  
'My dear fellow,'</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I should have said, 'consider what 
you are doing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You are making a most disgraceful 
connection, and such a one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as your family are unanimous in disapproving.' 
I cannot</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">help thinking, in short, that means 
might have been found.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But now it is all too late.  He must 
be starved, you know;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that is certain; absolutely starved.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He had just settled this point with 
great composure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when the entrance of Mrs. John Dashwood 
put an end to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subject.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But though SHE never spoke of it out 
of her own family,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could see its influence on 
her mind, in the something</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">like confusion of countenance with 
which she entered,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and an attempt at cordiality in her 
behaviour to herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She even proceeded so far as to be 
concerned to find</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Elinor and her sister were so 
soon to leave town,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she had hoped to see more of them;--an 
exertion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in which her husband, who attended 
her into the room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and hung enamoured over her accents, 
seemed to distinguish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every thing that was most affectionate 
and graceful.</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One other short call in Harley Street, 
in which Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">received her brother's congratulations 
on their travelling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so far towards Barton without any 
expense, and on Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon's being to follow them to 
Cleveland in a day or two,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">completed the intercourse of the brother 
and sisters</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in town;--and a faint invitation from 
Fanny, to come</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Norland whenever it should happen 
to be in their way,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which of all things was the most unlikely 
to occur,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a more warm, though less public, 
assurance, from John</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Elinor, of the promptitude with 
which he should come</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see her at Delaford, was all that 
foretold any meeting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the country.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It amused her to observe that all 
her friends seemed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">determined to send her to Delaford;--a 
place, in which,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all others, she would now least 
chuse to visit,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or wish to reside; for not only was 
it considered as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her future home by her brother and 
Mrs. Jennings, but even Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when they parted, gave her a pressing 
invitation to visit her there.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Very early in April, and tolerably 
early in the day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the two parties from Hanover Square 
and Berkeley Street set</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out from their respective homes, to 
meet, by appointment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the road.  For the convenience 
of Charlotte and her child,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they were to be more than two days 
on their journey,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mr. Palmer, travelling more expeditiously 
with Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was to join them at Cleveland soon 
after their arrival.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, few as had been her hours 
of comfort</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in London, and eager as she had long 
been to quit it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not, when it came to the point, 
bid adieu to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the house in which she had for the 
last time enjoyed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">those hopes, and that confidence, 
in Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which were now extinguished for ever, 
without great pain.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nor could she leave the place in which 
Willoughby remained,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">busy in new engagements, and new schemes, 
in which SHE</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could have no share, without shedding 
many tears.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's satisfaction, at the moment 
of removal,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was more positive.  She had no such 
object for her lingering</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thoughts to fix on, she left no creature 
behind, from whom</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it would give her a moment's regret 
to be divided for ever,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was pleased to be free herself 
from the persecution</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Lucy's friendship, she was grateful 
for bringing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister away unseen by Willoughby 
since his marriage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she looked forward with hope to 
what a few months</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of tranquility at Barton might do 
towards restoring</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's peace of mind, and confirming 
her own.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their journey was safely performed.  
The second</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">day brought them into the cherished, 
or the prohibited,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">county of Somerset, for as such was 
it dwelt on by turns</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Marianne's imagination; and in 
the forenoon of the third</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they drove up to Cleveland.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Cleveland was a spacious, modern-built 
house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">situated on a sloping lawn.  It had 
no park, but the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pleasure-grounds were tolerably extensive; 
and like</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every other place of the same degree 
of importance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it had its open shrubbery, and closer 
wood walk,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a road of smooth gravel winding round 
a plantation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">led to the front, the lawn was dotted 
over with timber,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the house itself was under the guardianship 
of the fir,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the mountain-ash, and the acacia, 
and a thick screen of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them altogether, interspersed with 
tall Lombardy poplars,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">shut out the offices.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne entered the house with a 
heart swelling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with emotion from the consciousness 
of being only eighty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">miles from Barton, and not thirty 
from Combe Magna;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and before she had been five minutes 
within its walls,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while the others were busily helping 
Charlotte to show</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her child to the housekeeper, she 
quitted it again,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stealing away through the winding 
shrubberies, now just</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beginning to be in beauty, to gain 
a distant eminence;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where, from its Grecian temple, her 
eye, wandering over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a wide tract of country to the south-east, 
could fondly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rest on the farthest ridge of hills 
in the horizon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and fancy that from their summits 
Combe Magna might be seen.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In such moments of precious, invaluable 
misery,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she rejoiced in tears of agony to 
be at Cleveland;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as she returned by a different 
circuit to the house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feeling all the happy privilege of 
country liberty,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of wandering from place to place in 
free and luxurious solitude,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she resolved to spend almost every 
hour of every day</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while she remained with the Palmers, 
in the indulgence of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such solitary rambles.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She returned just in time to join 
the others</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as they quitted the house, on an excursion 
through its</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more immediate premises; and the rest 
of the morning was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">easily whiled away, in lounging round 
the kitchen garden,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">examining the bloom upon its walls, 
and listening to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gardener's lamentations upon blights, 
in dawdling through</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the green-house, where the loss of 
her favourite plants,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unwarily exposed, and nipped by the 
lingering frost,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">raised the laughter of Charlotte,--and 
in visiting her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">poultry-yard, where, in the disappointed 
hopes of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dairy-maid, by hens forsaking their 
nests, or being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stolen by a fox, or in the rapid decrease 
of a promising</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">young brood, she found fresh sources 
of merriment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The morning was fine and dry, and 
Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her plan of employment abroad, 
had not calculated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for any change of weather during their 
stay at Cleveland.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With great surprise therefore, did 
she find herself prevented</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by a settled rain from going out again 
after dinner.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She had depended on a twilight walk 
to the Grecian temple,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and perhaps all over the grounds, 
and an evening merely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cold or damp would not have deterred 
her from it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but a heavy and settled rain even 
SHE could not fancy dry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or pleasant weather for walking.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their party was small, and the hours 
passed quietly away.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Palmer had her child, and Mrs. 
Jennings her carpet-work;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they talked of the friends they had 
left behind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">arranged Lady Middleton's engagements, 
and wondered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whether Mr. Palmer and Colonel Brandon 
would get farther</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than Reading that night.  Elinor, 
however little concerned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in it, joined in their discourse; 
and Marianne, who had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the knack of finding her way in every 
house to the library,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however it might be avoided by the 
family in general,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">soon procured herself a book.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nothing was wanting on Mrs. Palmer's 
side that constant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and friendly good humour could do, 
to make them feel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">themselves welcome.  The openness 
and heartiness of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">manner more than atoned for that want 
of recollection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and elegance which made her often 
deficient in the forms</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of politeness; her kindness, recommended 
by so pretty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a face, was engaging; her folly, though 
evident</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not disgusting, because it was 
not conceited;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor could have forgiven every 
thing but her laugh.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The two gentlemen arrived the next 
day to a very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">late dinner, affording a pleasant 
enlargement of the party,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a very welcome variety to their 
conversation, which a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">long morning of the same continued 
rain had reduced very low.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor had seen so little of Mr. Palmer, 
and in that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">little had seen so much variety in 
his address to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister and herself, that she knew 
not what to expect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to find him in his own family.  She 
found him, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perfectly the gentleman in his behaviour 
to all his visitors,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and only occasionally rude to his 
wife and her mother;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she found him very capable of being 
a pleasant companion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and only prevented from being so always, 
by too great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an aptitude to fancy himself as much 
superior to people</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in general, as he must feel himself 
to be to Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Charlotte.  For the rest of his 
character and habits,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they were marked, as far as Elinor 
could perceive,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with no traits at all unusual in his 
sex and time of life.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was nice in his eating, uncertain 
in his hours;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fond of his child, though affecting 
to slight it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and idled away the mornings at billiards, 
which ought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to have been devoted to business.  
She liked him, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">upon the whole, much better than she 
had expected, and in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her heart was not sorry that she could 
like him no more;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not sorry to be driven by the observation 
of his Epicurism,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his selfishness, and his conceit, 
to rest with complacency</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the remembrance of Edward's generous 
temper, simple taste,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and diffident feelings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Of Edward, or at least of some of 
his concerns,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she now received intelligence from 
Colonel Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who had been into Dorsetshire lately; 
and who,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">treating her at once as the disinterested 
friend</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Mr. Ferrars, and the kind of confidant 
of himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">talked to her a great deal of the 
parsonage at Delaford,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">described its deficiencies, and told 
her what he meant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to do himself towards removing them.--His 
behaviour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her in this, as well as in every 
other particular,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his open pleasure in meeting her after 
an absence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of only ten days, his readiness to 
converse with her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his deference for her opinion, 
might very well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">justify Mrs. Jennings's persuasion 
of his attachment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and would have been enough, perhaps, 
had not Elinor still,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as from the first, believed Marianne 
his real favourite,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make her suspect it herself.  But 
as it was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such a notion had scarcely ever entered 
her head,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">except by Mrs. Jennings's suggestion; 
and she could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not help believing herself the nicest 
observer of the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">two;--she watched his eyes, while 
Mrs. Jennings thought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only of his behaviour;--and while 
his looks of anxious</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">solicitude on Marianne's feeling, 
in her head and throat,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the beginning of a heavy cold, because 
unexpressed by words,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entirely escaped the latter lady's 
observation;--SHE could </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">discover in them the quick feelings, 
and needless alarm </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a lover.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Two delighful twilight walks on the 
third and fourth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">evenings of her being there, not merely 
on the dry gravel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the shrubbery, but all over the 
grounds, and especially</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the most distant parts of them, 
where there was something</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more of wildness than in the rest, 
where the trees were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the oldest, and the grass was the 
longest and wettest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had--assisted by the still greater 
imprudence of sitting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her wet shoes and stockings--given 
Marianne a cold</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so violent as, though for a day or 
two trifled with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or denied, would force itself by increasing 
ailments on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the concern of every body, and the 
notice of herself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Prescriptions poured in from all quarters, 
and as usual,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were all declined.  Though heavy and 
feverish, with a pain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her limbs, and a cough, and a sore 
throat, a good night's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rest was to cure her entirely; and 
it was with difficulty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Elinor prevailed on her, when 
she went to bed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to try one or two of the simplest 
of the remedies.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 43</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne got up the next morning at 
her usual time;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to every inquiry replied that she 
was better, and tried to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">prove herself so, by engaging in her 
accustomary employments.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But a day spent in sitting shivering 
over the fire</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a book in her hand, which she 
was unable to read,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or in lying, weary and languid, on 
a sofa, did not speak</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much in favour of her amendment; and 
when, at last,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she went early to bed, more and more 
indisposed, Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon was only astonished at her 
sister's composure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who, though attending and nursing 
her the whole day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against Marianne inclination, and 
forcing proper medicines</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her at night, trusted, like Marianne, 
to the certainty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and efficacy of sleep, and felt no 
real alarm.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A very restless and feverish night, 
however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">disappointed the expectation of both; 
and when Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after persisting in rising, confessed 
herself unable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to sit up, and returned voluntarily 
to her bed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. 
Jennings's advice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of sending for the Palmers' apothecary.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He came, examined his patient, and 
though encouraging</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood to expect that a very 
few days would restore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her sister to health, yet, by pronouncing 
her disorder</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to have a putrid tendency, and allowing 
the word &quot;infection&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to pass his lips, gave instant alarm 
to Mrs. Palmer,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her baby's account.  Mrs. Jennings, 
who had been inclined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the first to think Marianne's 
complaint more serious</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than Elinor, now looked very grave 
on Mr. Harris's report,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and confirming Charlotte's fears and 
caution, urged the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">necessity of her immediate removal 
with her infant;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mr. Palmer, though treating their 
apprehensions as idle,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">found the anxiety and importunity 
of his wife too great</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be withstood.  Her departure, therefore, 
was fixed on;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and within an hour after Mr. Harris's 
arrival, she set off,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with her little boy and his nurse, 
for the house of a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">near relation of Mr. Palmer's, who 
lived a few miles</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the other side of Bath; whither 
her husband promised,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at her earnest entreaty, to join her 
in a day or two;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and whither she was almost equally 
urgent with her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother to accompany her.  Mrs. Jennings, 
however, with a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">kindness of heart which made Elinor 
really love her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">declared her resolution of not stirring 
from Cleveland</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as long as Marianne remained ill, 
and of endeavouring,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by her own attentive care, to supply 
to her the place</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the mother she had taken her from; 
and Elinor found her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on every occasion a most willing and 
active helpmate,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">desirous to share in all her fatigues, 
and often by her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">better experience in nursing, of material 
use.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor Marianne, languid and low from 
the nature</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her malady, and feeling herself 
universally ill,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could no longer hope that tomorrow 
would find her recovered;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the idea of what tomorrow would 
have produced,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but for this unlucky illness, made 
every ailment severe;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for on that day they were to have 
begun their journey home;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and, attended the whole way by a servant 
of Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were to have taken their mother by 
surprise on the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">following forenoon.  The little she 
said was all in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lamentation of this inevitable delay; 
though Elinor tried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to raise her spirits, and make her 
believe, as she THEN</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">really believed herself, that it would 
be a very short one.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The next day produced little or no 
alteration in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">state of the patient; she certainly 
was not better, and,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">except that there was no amendment, 
did not appear worse.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their party was now farther reduced; 
for Mr. Palmer,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though very unwilling to go as well 
from real humanity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and good-nature, as from a dislike 
of appearing to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">frightened away by his wife, was persuaded 
at last</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Colonel Brandon to perform his 
promise of following her;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and while he was preparing to go, 
Colonel Brandon himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a much greater exertion, began 
to talk of going</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">likewise.--Here, however, the kindness 
of Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">interposed most acceptably; for to 
send the Colonel away</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while his love was in so much uneasiness 
on her sister's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">account, would be to deprive them 
both, she thought,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of every comfort; and therefore telling 
him at once</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that his stay at Cleveland was necessary 
to herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she should want him to play at 
piquet of an evening,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while Miss Dashwood was above with 
her sister, &amp;c. she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">urged him so strongly to remain, that 
he, who was gratifying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the first wish of his own heart by 
a compliance, could not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">long even affect to demur; especially 
as Mrs. Jennings's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entreaty was warmly seconded by Mr. 
Palmer, who seemed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to feel a relief to himself, in leaving 
behind him a person</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so well able to assist or advise Miss 
Dashwood in any emergence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance 
of all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">these arrangements.  She knew not 
that she had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the means of sending the owners of 
Cleveland away,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in about seven days from the time 
of their arrival.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It gave her no surprise that she saw 
nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Mrs. Palmer; and as it gave her 
likewise no concern,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she never mentioned her name.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Two days passed away from the time 
of Mr. Palmer's departure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her situation continued, with 
little variation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the same.  Mr. Harris, who attended 
her every day,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, 
and Miss Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was equally sanguine; but the expectation 
of the others</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was by no means so cheerful. Mrs. 
Jennings had determined</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very early in the seizure that Marianne 
would never</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">get over it, and Colonel Brandon, 
who was chiefly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings's 
forebodings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not in a state of mind to resist 
their influence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He tried to reason himself out of 
fears, which the different</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">judgment of the apothecary seemed 
to render absurd;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the many hours of each day in 
which he was left</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entirely alone, were but too favourable 
for the admission</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of every melancholy idea, and he could 
not expel from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his mind the persuasion that he should 
see Marianne no more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">On the morning of the third day however, 
the gloomy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">anticipations of both were almost 
done away; for when</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Harris arrived, he declared his 
patient materially better.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her pulse was much stronger, and every 
symptom more favourable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than on the preceding visit.  Elinor, 
confirmed in every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; 
rejoicing that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her letters to her mother, she 
had pursued her own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">judgment rather than her friend's, 
in making very light</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the indisposition which delayed 
them at Cleveland;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and almost fixing on the time when 
Marianne would be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">able to travel.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But the day did not close so auspiciously 
as it began.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Towards the evening Marianne became 
ill again, growing </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more heavy, restless, and uncomfortable 
than before.  </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her sister, however, still sanguine, 
was willing to </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attribute the change to nothing more 
than the fatigue </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of having sat up to have her bed made; 
and carefully </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">administering the cordials prescribed, 
saw her, with </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">satisfaction, sink at last into a 
slumber, from which </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she expected the most beneficial effects.  
Her sleep, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though not so quiet as Elinor wished 
to see it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lasted a considerable time; and anxious 
to observe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the result of it herself, she resolved 
to sit with her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">during the whole of it.  Mrs. Jennings, 
knowing nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of any change in the patient, went 
unusually early to bed;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her maid, who was one of the principal 
nurses, was recreating</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself in the housekeeper's room, 
and Elinor remained</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">alone with Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The repose of the latter became more 
and more disturbed;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her sister, who watched, with 
unremitting attention</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her continual change of posture, and 
heard the frequent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but inarticulate sounds of complaint 
which passed her lips,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was almost wishing to rouse her from 
so painful a slumber,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when Marianne, suddenly awakened by 
some accidental noise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the house, started hastily up, 
and, with feverish wildness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cried out,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is mama coming?--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Not yet,&quot; cried the other, 
concealing her terror,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and assisting Marianne to lie down 
again, &quot;but she will</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be here, I hope, before it is long.  
It is a great way,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you know, from hence to Barton.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But she must not go round by 
London,&quot; cried Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the same hurried manner. &quot;I 
shall never see her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if she goes by London.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor perceived with alarm that she 
was not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite herself, and, while attempting 
to soothe her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">eagerly felt her pulse. It was lower 
and quicker than ever!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne, still talking wildly 
of mama, her alarm</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">increased so rapidly, as to determine 
her on sending</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">instantly for Mr. Harris, and despatching 
a messenger</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Barton for her mother.  To consult 
with Colonel Brandon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the best means of effecting the 
latter, was a thought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which immediately followed the resolution 
of its performance;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as soon she had rung up the maid 
to take her place</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by her sister, she hastened down to 
the drawing-room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where she knew he was generally to 
be found at a much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">later hour than the present.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was no time for hesitation.  Her 
fears and her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">difficulties were immediately before 
him.  Her fears,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he had no courage, no confidence to 
attempt the removal of:--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he listened to them in silent despondence;--but 
her </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">difficulties were instantly obviated, 
for with a readiness </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that seemed to speak the occasion, 
and the service </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pre-arranged in his mind, he offered 
himself as the </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.  
Elinor made no </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">resistance that was not easily overcome.  
She thanked him </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with brief, though fervent gratitude, 
and while he went</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to hurry off his servant with a message 
to Mr. Harris, and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an order for post-horses directly, 
she wrote a few lines </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The comfort of such a friend at that 
moment as Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon--or such a companion for her 
mother,--how gratefully</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was it felt!--a companion whose judgment 
would guide,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whose attendance must relieve, and 
whose friendship might </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">soothe her!--as far as the shock of 
such a summons COULD </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be lessened to her, his presence, 
his manners, his assistance, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would lessen it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">HE, meanwhile, whatever he might feel, 
acted with all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the firmness of a collected mind, 
made every necessary</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">arrangement with the utmost despatch, 
and calculated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with exactness the time in which she 
might look for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his return.  Not a moment was lost 
in delay of any kind.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The horses arrived, even before they 
were expected,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Colonel Brandon only pressing 
her hand with a look</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of solemnity, and a few words spoken 
too low to reach her ear,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hurried into the carriage.  It was 
then about twelve</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">o'clock, and she returned to her sister's 
apartment to wait</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the arrival of the apothecary, 
and to watch by her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the rest of the night.  It was a night 
of almost equal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suffering to both.  Hour after hour 
passed away in sleepless</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pain and delirium on Marianne's side, 
and in the most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cruel anxiety on Elinor's, before 
Mr. Harris appeared.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her apprehensions once raised, paid 
by their excess for all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her former security; and the servant 
who sat up with her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for she would not allow Mrs. Jennings 
to be called,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only tortured her more, by hints of 
what her mistress</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had always thought.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's ideas were still, at intervals,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fixed incoherently on her mother, 
and whenever she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mentioned her name, it gave a pang 
to the heart of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself 
for having trifled</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with so many days of illness, and 
wretched for some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediate relief, fancied that all 
relief might soon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be in vain, that every thing had been 
delayed too long,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and pictured to herself her suffering 
mother arriving</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too late to see this darling child, 
or to see her rational.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was on the point of sending again 
for Mr. Harris,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or if HE could not come, for some 
other advice, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when the former--but not till after 
five o'clock--arrived.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His opinion, however, made some little 
amends for his delay,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for though acknowledging a very unexpected 
and unpleasant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">alteration in his patient, he would 
not allow the danger</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be material, and talked of the 
relief which a fresh</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mode of treatment must procure, with 
a confidence which,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a lesser degree, was communicated 
to Elinor.  He promised</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to call again in the course of three 
or four hours,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and left both the patient and her 
anxious attendant more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">composed than he had found them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With strong concern, and with many 
reproaches for not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being called to their aid, did Mrs. 
Jennings hear in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">morning of what had passed.  Her former 
apprehensions,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now with greater reason restored, 
left her no doubt of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the event; and though trying to speak 
comfort to Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her conviction of her sister's danger 
would not allow her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to offer the comfort of hope.  Her 
heart was really grieved.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The rapid decay, the early death of 
a girl so young,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so lovely as Marianne, must have struck 
a less interested</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">person with concern.  On Mrs. Jennings's 
compassion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had other claims.  She had been 
for three months</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her companion, was still under her 
care, and she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">known to have been greatly injured, 
and long unhappy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The distress of her sister too, particularly 
a favourite,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was before her;--and as for their 
mother, when Mrs. Jennings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">considered that Marianne might probably 
be to HER what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Charlotte was to herself, her sympathy 
in HER sufferings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was very sincere.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Harris was punctual in his second 
visit;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but he came to be disappointed in 
his hopes of what the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">last would produce. His medicines 
had failed;--the fever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was unabated; and Marianne only more 
quiet--not more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself--remained in a heavy stupor.  
Elinor, catching all,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and more than all, his fears in a 
moment, proposed to call</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in further advice.  But he judged 
it unnecessary: he had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">still something more to try, some 
more fresh application,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of whose success he was as confident 
as the last, and his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">visit concluded with encouraging assurances 
which reached</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the ear, but could not enter the heart 
of Miss Dashwood.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was calm, except when she thought 
of her mother;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but she was almost hopeless; and in 
this state she continued</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">till noon, scarcely stirring from 
her sister's bed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her thoughts wandering from one image 
of grief,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one suffering friend to another, and 
her spirits oppressed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the utmost by the conversation 
of Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who scrupled not to attribute the 
severity and danger</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of this attack to the many weeks of 
previous indisposition</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which Marianne's disappointment had 
brought on.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor felt all the reasonableness 
of the idea, and it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gave fresh misery to her reflections.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">About noon, however, she began--but 
with a caution--a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dread of disappointment which for 
some time kept her silent,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even to her friend--to fancy, to hope 
she could perceive</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a slight amendment in her sister's 
pulse;--she waited,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">watched, and examined it again and 
again;--and at last,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with an agitation more difficult to 
bury under exterior calmness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than all her foregoing distress, ventured 
to communicate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her hopes.  Mrs. Jennings, though 
forced, on examination,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to acknowledge a temporary revival, 
tried to keep her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">young friend from indulging a thought 
of its continuance;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor, conning over every injunction 
of distrust,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">told herself likewise not to hope.  
But it was too late.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Hope had already entered; and feeling 
all its anxious flutter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she bent over her sister to watch--she 
hardly knew for what.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Half an hour passed away, and the 
favourable symptom</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yet blessed her. Others even arose 
to confirm it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her breath, her skin, her lips, all 
flattered Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with signs of amendment; and Marianne 
fixed her eyes on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her with a rational, though languid, 
gaze.  Anxiety and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hope now oppressed her in equal degrees, 
and left her no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">moment of tranquillity till the arrival 
of Mr. Harris at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">four o'clock;--when his assurances, 
his felicitations on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a recovery in her sister even surpassing 
his expectation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gave her confidence, comfort, and 
tears of joy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne was in every respect materially 
better,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he declared her entirely out of 
danger. Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perhaps satisfied with the partial 
justification of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">forebodings which had been found in 
their late alarm,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">allowed herself to trust in his judgment, 
and admitted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with unfeigned joy, and soon with 
unequivocal cheerfulness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the probability of an entire recovery.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not be cheerful.  Her 
joy was of a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">different kind, and led to any thing 
rather than to gaiety.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne restored to life, health, 
friends, and to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">doting mother, was an idea to fill 
her heart with sensations</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of exquisite comfort, and expand it 
in fervent gratitude;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but it lead to no outward demonstrations 
of joy, no words,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no smiles.  All within Elinor's breast 
was satisfaction,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">silent and strong.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She continued by the side of her sister, 
with little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intermission the whole afternoon, 
calming every fear,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">satisfying every inquiry of her enfeebled 
spirits,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">supplying every succour, and watching 
almost every look and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every breath.  The possibility of 
a relapse would of course,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in some moments, occur to remind her 
of what anxiety was--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but when she saw, on her frequent 
and minute examination,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that every symptom of recovery continued, 
and saw Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at six o'clock sink into a quiet, 
steady, and to all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">appearance comfortable, sleep, she 
silenced every doubt.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The time was now drawing on, when 
Colonel Brandon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might be expected back.  At ten o'clock, 
she trusted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or at least not much later her mother 
would be relieved</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the dreadful suspense in which 
she must now be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">travelling towards them.  The Colonel, 
too!--perhaps scarcely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">less an object of pity!--Oh!--how 
slow was the progress</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of time which yet kept them in ignorance!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At seven o'clock, leaving Marianne 
still sweetly asleep,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she joined Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room 
to tea.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Of breakfast she had been kept by 
her fears, and of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dinner by their sudden reverse, from 
eating much;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the present refreshment, therefore, 
with such feelings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of content as she brought to it, was 
particularly welcome.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings would have persuaded 
her, at its conclusion,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to take some rest before her mother's 
arrival, and allow HER to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">take her place by Marianne; but Elinor 
had no sense of fatigue,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no capability of sleep at that moment 
about her, and she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not to be kept away from her sister 
an unnecessary instant.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings therefore attending 
her up stairs into the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sick chamber, to satisfy herself that 
all continued right,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">left her there again to her charge 
and her thoughts,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and retired to her own room to write 
letters and sleep.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The night was cold and stormy.  The 
wind roared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">round the house, and the rain beat 
against the windows;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Elinor, all happiness within, 
regarded it not.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne slept through every blast; 
and the travellers--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they had a rich reward in store, for 
every present inconvenience.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The clock struck eight.  Had it been 
ten,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor would have been convinced that 
at that moment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she heard a carriage driving up to 
the house;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and so strong was the persuasion that 
she DID, in spite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the ALMOST impossibility of their 
being already come,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she moved into the adjoining 
dressing-closet and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opened a window shutter, to be satisfied 
of the truth.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She instantly saw that her ears had 
not deceived her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The flaring lamps of a carriage were 
immediately in view.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">By their uncertain light she thought 
she could discern it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be drawn by four horses; and this, 
while it told the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">excess of her poor mother's alarm, 
gave some explanation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to such unexpected rapidity.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Never in her life had Elinor found 
it so difficult</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be calm, as at that moment.  The 
knowledge of what her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother must be feeling as the carriage 
stopt at the door--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her doubt--her dread--perhaps her 
despair!--and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what SHE had to tell!--with such 
knowledge it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">impossible to be calm. All that remained 
to be done</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was to be speedy; and, therefore staying 
only till</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she could leave Mrs. Jennings's maid 
with her sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she hurried down stairs.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The bustle in the vestibule, as she 
passed along</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an inner lobby, assured her that they 
were already</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the house.  She rushed to the drawing-room,--she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entered it,--and saw only Willoughby.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 44</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, starting back with a look 
of horror at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the sight of him, obeyed the first 
impulse of her heart</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in turning instantly to quit the room, 
and her hand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was already on the lock, when its 
action was suspended</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by his hastily advancing, and saying, 
in a voice rather</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of command than supplication,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Miss Dashwood, for half an hour--for 
ten minutes--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I entreat you to stay.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, sir,&quot; she replied with 
firmness, &quot;I shall NOT stay.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Your business cannot be with ME.  
The servants, I suppose,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">forgot to tell you that Mr. Palmer 
was not in the house.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Had they told me,&quot; he cried 
with vehemence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;that Mr. Palmer and all his 
relations were at the devil,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it would not have turned me from the 
door.  My business</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is with you, and only you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;With me!&quot;--in the utmost 
amazement--&quot;well, sir,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be quick--and if you can--less violent.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Sit down, and I will be both.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She hesitated; she knew not what to 
do.  The possibility</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Colonel Brandon's arriving and 
finding her there,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">came across her.  But she had promised 
to hear him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her curiosity no less than her 
honor was engaged.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After a moment's recollection, therefore, 
concluding that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">prudence required dispatch, and that 
her acquiescence would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">best promote it, she walked silently 
towards the table,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sat down. He took the opposite 
chair, and for half</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a minute not a word was said by either.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Pray be quick, sir,&quot;--said 
Elinor, impatiently;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have no time to spare.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was sitting in an attitude of deep 
meditation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and seemed not to hear her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your sister,&quot; said he, 
with abruptness, a moment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">afterwards--&quot;is out of danger.  
I heard it from the servant.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">God be praised!--But is it true? is 
it really true?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor would not speak.  He repeated 
the inquiry with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yet greater eagerness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;For God's sake tell me, is she 
out of danger, or is she not?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We hope she is.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He rose up, and walked across the 
room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Had I known as much half an 
hour ago--But</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">since I AM here,&quot;--speaking with 
a forced vivacity as he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">returned to his seat--&quot;what does 
it signify?--For once,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood--it will be the last 
time, perhaps--let us</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be cheerful together.--I am in a fine 
mood for gaiety.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Tell me honestly&quot;--a deeper glow 
overspreading his cheeks--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;do you think me most a knave 
or a fool?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor looked at him with greater 
astonishment than ever.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She began to think that be must be 
in liquor;--the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">strangeness of such a visit, and of 
such manners,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed no otherwise intelligible; 
and with this impression</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she immediately rose, saying,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mr. Willoughby, I advise you 
at present to return</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Combe--I am not at leisure to remain 
with you longer.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Whatever your business may be with 
me, will it be better</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">recollected and explained to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I understand you,&quot; he replied, 
with an expressive smile,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a voice perfectly calm; &quot;yes, 
I am very drunk.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A pint of porter with my cold beef 
at Marlborough was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enough to over-set me.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;At Marlborough!&quot;--cried 
Elinor, more and more at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a loss to understand what he would 
be at.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes,--I left London this morning 
at eight o'clock,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the only ten minutes I have spent 
out of my chaise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">since that time procured me a nuncheon 
at Marlborough.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The steadiness of his manner, and 
the intelligence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his eye as he spoke, convincing 
Elinor, that whatever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other unpardonable folly might bring 
him to Cleveland,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he was not brought there by intoxication, 
she said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after a moment's recollection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mr. Willoughby, you OUGHT to 
feel, and I certainly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">DO--that after what has passed--your 
coming here in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this manner, and forcing yourself 
upon my notice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">requires a very particular excuse.--What 
is it, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that you mean by it?&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I mean,&quot;--said he, with 
serious energy--&quot;if I can,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make you hate me one degree less 
than you do NOW.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I mean to offer some kind of explanation, 
some kind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of apology, for the past; to open 
my whole heart to you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and by convincing you, that though 
I have been always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a blockhead, I have not been always 
a rascal, to obtain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">something like forgiveness from Ma--from 
your sister.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is this the real reason of your 
coming?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Upon my soul it is,&quot;--was 
his answer, with a warmth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which brought all the former Willoughby 
to her remembrance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in spite of herself made her think 
him sincere.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If that is all, you may be satisfied 
already,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Marianne DOES--she has LONG forgiven 
you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Has she?&quot;--he cried, in 
the same eager tone.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Then she has forgiven me before 
she ought to have done it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But she shall forgive me again, and 
on more reasonable </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">grounds.--NOW will you listen to me?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor bowed her assent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not know,&quot; said he, 
after a pause of expectation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her side, and thoughtfulness on 
his own,--&quot;how YOU</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may have accounted for my behaviour 
to your sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or what diabolical motive you may 
have imputed to me.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Perhaps you will hardly think the 
better of me,--it is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">worth the trial however, and you shall 
hear every thing.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When I first became intimate in your 
family, I had no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other intention, no other view in 
the acquaintance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than to pass my time pleasantly while 
I was obliged to remain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Devonshire, more pleasantly than 
I had ever done before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Your sister's lovely person and interesting 
manners</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not but please me; and her behaviour 
to me almost</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the first, was of a kind--It 
is astonishing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when I reflect on what it was, and 
what SHE was, that my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">heart should have been so insensible! But 
at first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I must confess, my vanity only was 
elevated by it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Careless of her happiness, thinking 
only of my own amusement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">giving way to feelings which I had 
always been too much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, 
by every means</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in my power, to make myself pleasing 
to her, without any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">design of returning her affection.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning 
her eyes on him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the most angry contempt, stopped 
him, by saying,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is hardly worth while, Mr. 
Willoughby,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for you to relate, or for me to listen 
any longer.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Such a beginning as this cannot be 
followed by any thing.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Do not let me be pained by hearing 
any thing more on</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the subject.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I insist on you hearing the 
whole of it,&quot;he replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;My fortune was never large, 
and I had always been expensive,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">always in the habit of associating 
with people of better</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">income than myself.  Every year since 
my coming of age,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or even before, I believe, had added 
to my debts; and though</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, 
was to set me free;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yet that event being uncertain, and 
possibly far distant,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it had been for some time my intention 
to re-establish my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">circumstances by marrying a woman 
of fortune.  To attach</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself to your sister, therefore, 
was not a thing to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thought of;--and with a meanness, 
selfishness, cruelty--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which no indignant, no contemptuous 
look, even of yours,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood, can ever reprobate 
too much--I was acting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in this manner, trying to engage her 
regard, without a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thought of returning it.--But one 
thing may be said</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for me: even in that horrid state 
of selfish vanity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I did not know the extent of the injury 
I meditated,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because I did not THEN know what it 
was to love.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But have I ever known it?--Well may 
it be doubted; for, had I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">really loved, could I have sacrificed 
my feelings to vanity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to avarice?--or, what is more, could 
I have sacrificed hers?--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I have done it.  To avoid a comparative 
poverty,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which her affection and her society 
would have deprived</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all its horrors, I have, by raising 
myself to affluence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lost every thing that could make it 
a blessing.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You did then,&quot; said Elinor, 
a little softened,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;believe yourself at one time 
attached to her?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To have resisted such attractions, 
to have withstood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such tenderness!--Is there a man on 
earth who could have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">done it?--Yes, I found myself, by 
insensible degrees,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sincerely fond of her; and the happiest 
hours of my life</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were what I spent with her when I 
felt my intentions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were strictly honourable, and my feelings 
blameless.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Even THEN, however, when fully determined 
on paying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my addresses to her, I allowed myself 
most improperly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to put off, from day to day, the moment 
of doing it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from an unwillingness to enter into 
an engagement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while my circumstances were so greatly 
embarrassed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I will not reason here--nor will I 
stop for YOU to expatiate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the absurdity, and the worse than 
absurdity, of scrupling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to engage my faith where my honour 
was already bound.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The event has proved, that I was a 
cunning fool,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">providing with great circumspection 
for a possible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opportunity of making myself contemptible 
and wretched</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for ever.  At last, however, my resolution 
was taken,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I had determined, as soon as I 
could engage her alone,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to justify the attentions I had so 
invariably paid her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and openly assure her of an affection 
which I had already</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">taken such pains to display.  But 
in the interim--in the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">interim of the very few hours that 
were to pass, before I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could have an opportunity of speaking 
with her in private--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a circumstance occurred--an unlucky 
circumstance, to ruin </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all my resolution, and with it all 
my comfort.  A discovery </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">took place,&quot;--here he hesitated 
and looked down.--&quot;Mrs. Smith </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had somehow or other been informed, 
I imagine by some </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">distant relation, whose interest it 
was to deprive me of </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her favour, of an affair, a connection--but 
I need not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">explain myself farther,&quot; he added, 
looking at her with an </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">heightened colour and an enquiring 
eye--&quot;your particular </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intimacy--you have probably heard 
the whole story long ago.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have,&quot;returned Elinor, 
colouring likewise,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and hardening her heart anew against 
any compassion for him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have heard it all.  And how 
you will explain away any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">part of your guilt in that dreadful 
business, I confess</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is beyond my comprehension.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Remember,&quot; cried Willoughby,&quot;from 
whom you received</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the account. Could it be an impartial 
one?  I acknowledge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that her situation and her character 
ought to have been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">respected by me.  I do not mean to 
justify myself, but at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the same time cannot leave you to 
suppose that I have nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to urge--that because she was injured 
she was irreproachable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and because I was a libertine, SHE 
must be a saint.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If the violence of her passions, the 
weakness of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">understanding--I do not mean, however, 
to defend myself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her affection for me deserved better 
treatment, and I often,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with great self-reproach, recall the 
tenderness which,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a very short time, had the power 
of creating any return.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I wish--I heartily wish it had never 
been.  But I have injured</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more than herself; and I have injured 
one, whose affection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for me--(may I say it?) was scarcely 
less warm than hers;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and whose mind--Oh! how infinitely 
superior!&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your indifference, however, 
towards that unfortunate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">girl--I must say it, unpleasant to 
me as the discussion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of such a subject may well be--your 
indifference is no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">apology for your cruel neglect of 
her.  Do not think yourself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">excused by any weakness, any natural 
defect of understanding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on her side, in the wanton cruelty 
so evident on yours.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You must have known, that while you 
were enjoying yourself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, 
always gay,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">always happy, she was reduced to the 
extremest indigence.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But, upon my soul, I did NOT 
know it,&quot; he warmly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">replied; &quot;I did not recollect 
that I had omitted to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her my direction; and common sense 
might have told her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how to find it out.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, sir, and what said Mrs. 
Smith?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She taxed me with the offence 
at once, and my confusion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may be guessed.  The purity of her 
life, the formality</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her notions, her ignorance of the 
world--every thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was against me. The matter itself 
I could not deny,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and vain was every endeavour to soften 
it.  She was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">previously disposed, I believe, to 
doubt the morality of my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conduct in general, and was moreover 
discontented with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the very little attention, the very 
little portion of my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time that I had bestowed on her, in 
my present visit.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In short, it ended in a total breach.  
By one measure I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might have saved myself. In the height 
of her morality,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good woman! she offered to forgive 
the past, if I would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">marry Eliza.  That could not be--and 
I was formally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">dismissed from her favour and her 
house.  The night</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">following this affair--I was to go 
the next morning--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was spent by me in deliberating on 
what my future conduct</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should be. The struggle was great--but 
it ended too soon.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My affection for Marianne, my thorough 
conviction of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attachment to me--it was all insufficient 
to outweigh</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that dread of poverty, or get the 
better of those false</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ideas of the necessity of riches, 
which I was naturally</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inclined to feel, and expensive society 
had increased.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had reason to believe myself secure 
of my present wife,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if I chose to address her, and I persuaded 
myself to think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that nothing else in common prudence 
remained for me to do.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A heavy scene however awaited me, 
before I could leave</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Devonshire;--I was engaged to dine 
with you on that very day;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some apology was therefore necessary 
for my breaking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this engagement.  But whether I should 
write this apology,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or deliver it in person, was a point 
of long debate.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To see Marianne, I felt, would be 
dreadful, and I even doubted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whether I could see her again, and 
keep to my resolution.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In that point, however, I undervalued 
my own magnanimity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the event declared; for I went, 
I saw her, and saw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her miserable, and left her miserable--and 
left her hoping</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never to see her again.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?&quot; 
said Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reproachfully; &quot;a note would 
have answered every purpose.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Why was it necessary to call?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It was necessary to my own pride.  
I could not bear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to leave the country in a manner that 
might lead you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or the rest of the neighbourhood, 
to suspect any part</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what had really passed between 
Mrs. Smith and myself--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I resolved therefore on calling 
at the cottage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in my way to Honiton.  The sight of 
your dear sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, was really dreadful; and, 
to heighten the matter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I found her alone.  You were all gone 
I do not know where.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had left her only the evening before, 
so fully,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so firmly resolved within my self 
on doing right! </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A few hours were to have engaged her 
to me for ever;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I remember how happy, how gay 
were my spirits, as I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">walked from the cottage to Allenham, 
satisfied with myself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">delighted with every body!  But in 
this, our last interview</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of friendship, I approached her with 
a sense of guilt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that almost took from me the power 
of dissembling.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her sorrow, her disappointment, her 
deep regret, when I told</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her that I was obliged to leave Devonshire 
so immediately--I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never shall forget it--united too 
with such reliance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such confidence in me!--Oh, God!--what 
a hard-hearted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rascal I was!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were both silent for a few moments.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor first spoke.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did you tell her that you should 
soon return?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do not know what I told her,&quot; 
he replied, impatiently;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;less than was due to the past, 
beyond a doubt, and in all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">likelihood much more than was justified 
by the future.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I cannot think of it.--It won't do.--Then 
came your dear mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to torture me farther, with all her 
kindness and confidence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Thank Heaven! it DID torture me.  
I was miserable.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an 
idea of the comfort it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gives me to look back on my own misery.  
I owe such a grudge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to myself for the stupid, rascally 
folly of my own heart,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that all my past sufferings under 
it are only triumph and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exultation to me now.  Well, I went, 
left all that I loved,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and went to those to whom, at best, 
I was only indifferent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My journey to town--travelling with 
my own horses,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and therefore so tediously--no creature 
to speak to--my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">own reflections so cheerful--when 
I looked forward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every thing so inviting!--when I looked 
back at Barton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the picture so soothing!--oh, it was 
a blessed journey!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He stopped.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, sir,&quot; said Elinor, 
who, though pitying him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">grew impatient for his departure, 
&quot;and this is all?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Ah!--no,--have you forgot what 
passed in town?--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">That infamous letter--Did she shew 
it you?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, I saw every note that passed.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;When the first of hers reached 
me (as it immediately did,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I was in town the whole time,) 
what I felt is--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the common phrase, not to be expressed; 
in a more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">simple one--perhaps too simple to 
raise any emotion--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my feelings were very, very painful.--Every 
line, every word</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was--in the hackneyed metaphor which 
their dear writer,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were she here, would forbid--a dagger 
to my heart.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To know that Marianne was in town 
was--in the same language--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a thunderbolt.--Thunderbolts and daggers!--what 
a reproof</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would she have given me!--her taste, 
her opinions--I believe</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they are better known to me than my 
own,--and I am sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they are dearer.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's heart, which had undergone 
many changes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the course of this extraordinary 
conversation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was now softened again;--yet she felt 
it her duty to check</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such ideas in her companion as the 
last.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.--Remember 
that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you are married.  Relate only what 
in your conscience</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you think necessary for me to hear.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Marianne's note, by assuring 
me that I was still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as dear to her as in former days, 
that in spite of the many,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">many weeks we had been separated, 
she was as constant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her own feelings, and as full of 
faith in the constancy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of mine as ever, awakened all my remorse. I 
say awakened,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because time and London, business 
and dissipation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had in some measure quieted it, and 
I had been growing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a fine hardened villain, fancying 
myself indifferent to her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and chusing to fancy that she too 
must have become</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indifferent to me; talking to myself 
of our past attachment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as a mere idle, trifling business, 
shrugging up my shoulders</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in proof of its being so, and silencing 
every reproach,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">overcoming every scruple, by secretly 
saying now and then,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">'I shall be heartily glad to hear 
she is well married.'--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But this note made me know myself 
better.  I felt that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she was infinitely dearer to me than 
any other woman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the world, and that I was using 
her infamously.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But every thing was then just settled 
between Miss Grey</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and me.  To retreat was impossible.  
All that I had to do,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was to avoid you both.  I sent no 
answer to Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">intending by that to preserve myself 
from her farther notice;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and for some time I was even determined 
not to call in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Berkeley Street;--but at last, judging 
it wiser to affect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the air of a cool, common acquaintance 
than anything else,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I watched you all safely out of the 
house one morning,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and left my name.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Watched us out of the house!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Even so. You would be surprised 
to hear how often</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I watched you, how often I was on 
the point of falling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in with you. I have entered many a 
shop to avoid your sight,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the carriage drove by.  Lodging 
as I did in Bond Street,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there was hardly a day in which I 
did not catch a glimpse</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of one or other of you; and nothing 
but the most constant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">watchfulness on my side, a most invariably 
prevailing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">desire to keep out of your sight, 
could have separated us</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so long.  I avoided the Middletons 
as much as possible,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as well as everybody else who was 
likely to prove</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an acquaintance in common.  Not aware 
of their being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in town, however, I blundered on Sir 
John, I believe,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the first day of his coming, and the 
day after I had called</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at Mrs. Jennings's.  He asked me to 
a party, a dance at his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">house in the evening.--Had he NOT 
told me as an inducement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that you and your sister were to be 
there, I should have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">felt it too certain a thing, to trust 
myself near him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The next morning brought another short 
note from Marianne--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">still affectionate, open, artless, 
confiding--everything</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that could make MY conduct most hateful.  
I could not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">answer it.  I tried--but could not 
frame a sentence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But I thought of her, I believe, every 
moment of the day.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If you CAN pity me, Miss Dashwood, 
pity my situation as it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was THEN.  With my head and heart 
full of your sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I was forced to play the happy lover 
to another woman!--Those</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">three or four weeks were worse than 
all.  Well, at last,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as I need not tell you, you were forced 
on me; and what a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sweet figure I cut!--what an evening 
of agony it was!-- </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne, beautiful as an angel on 
one side, calling me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby in such a tone!--Oh, God!--holding 
out her hand </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to me, asking me for an explanation, 
with those bewitching </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">eyes fixed in such speaking solicitude 
on my face!--and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sophia, jealous as the devil on the 
other hand, looking </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all that was--Well, it does not signify; 
it is over now.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Such an evening!--I ran away from 
you all as soon as I could;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but not before I had seen Marianne's 
sweet face as white</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as death.--THAT was the last, last 
look I ever had of her;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the last manner in which she appeared 
to me.  It was a horrid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sight!--yet when I thought of her 
to-day as really dying,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was a kind of comfort to me to 
imagine that I knew</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exactly how she would appear to those, 
who saw her last</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in this world.  She was before me, 
constantly before me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as I travelled, in the same look and 
hue.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness 
succeeded.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby first rousing himself, 
broke it thus:</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well, let me make haste and 
be gone.  Your sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is certainly better, certainly out 
of danger?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We are assured of it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your poor mother, too!--doting 
on Marianne.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, 
your own letter;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have you any thing to say about that?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, yes, THAT in particular.  
Your sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wrote to me again, you know, the very 
next morning.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You saw what she said.  I was breakfasting 
at the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Ellisons,--and her letter, with some 
others, was brought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to me there from my lodgings.  It 
happened to catch</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sophia's eye before it caught mine--and 
its size,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing 
altogether,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately gave her a suspicion.  
Some vague report had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reached her before of my attachment 
to some young lady</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Devonshire, and what had passed 
within her observation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the preceding evening had marked who 
the young lady was,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and made her more jealous than ever.  
Affecting that air</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of playfulness, therefore, which is 
delightful in a woman</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one loves, she opened the letter directly, 
and read</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its contents. She was well paid for 
her impudence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She read what made her wretched.  
Her wretchedness I could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have borne, but her passion--her malice--At 
all events it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must be appeased.  And, in short--what 
do you think of my </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wife's style of letter-writing?--delicate--tender--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">truly feminine--was it not?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your wife!--The letter was in 
your own hand-writing.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, but I had only the credit 
of servilely copying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such sentences as I was ashamed to 
put my name to.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The original was all her own--her 
own happy thoughts</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and gentle diction.  But what could 
I do!--we were engaged,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every thing in preparation, the day 
almost fixed--But I am</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">talking like a fool.  Preparation!--day!--In 
honest words,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her money was necessary to me, and 
in a situation like</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mine, any thing was to be done to 
prevent a rupture.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And after all, what did it signify 
to my character</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the opinion of Marianne and her 
friends, in what language</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my answer was couched?--It must have 
been only to one end.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My business was to declare myself 
a scoundrel, and whether</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I did it with a bow or a bluster was 
of little importance.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">'I am ruined for ever in their opinion--' 
said I to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself--'I am shut out for ever from 
their society,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they already think me an unprincipled 
fellow, this letter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will only make them think me a blackguard 
one.' Such were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my reasonings, as, in a sort of desperate 
carelessness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I copied my wife's words, and parted 
with the last relics</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Marianne.  Her three notes--unluckily 
they were all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in my pocketbook, or I should have 
denied their existence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and hoarded them for ever--I was forced 
to put them up,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and could not even kiss them.  And 
the lock of hair--that too</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had always carried about me in the 
same pocket-book,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which was now searched by Madam with 
the most ingratiating</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">virulence,--the dear lock--all, every 
memento was torn from me.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, 
very blamable,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Elinor, while her voice, in spite 
of herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">betrayed her compassionate emotion; 
&quot;you ought not to speak</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby 
or my sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You had made your own choice.  It 
was not forced on you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Your wife has a claim to your politeness, 
to your respect,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at least.  She must be attached to 
you, or she would not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have married you.  To treat her with 
unkindness, to speak</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her slightingly is no atonement 
to Marianne--nor can I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suppose it a relief to your own conscience.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do not talk to me of my wife,&quot; 
said he with a heavy sigh.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She does not deserve your compassion.--She 
knew I had no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">regard for her when we married.--Well, 
married we were,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and came down to Combe Magna to be 
happy, and afterwards</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">returned to town to be gay.--And now 
do you pity me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood?--or have I said all 
this to no purpose?-- </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Am I--be it only one degree--am I 
less guilty in your opinion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than I was before?--My intentions 
were not always wrong.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Have I explained away any part of 
my guilt?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, you have certainly removed 
something--a little.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">You have proved yourself, on the whole, 
less faulty than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had believed you.  You have proved 
your heart less wicked,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much less wicked. But I hardly know--the 
misery that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you have inflicted--I hardly know 
what could have made</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it worse.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Will you repeat to your sister 
when she is recovered,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what I have been telling you?--Let 
me be a little lightened</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too in her opinion as well as in yours.  
You tell me that </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she has forgiven me already.  Let 
me be able to fancy that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a better knowledge of my heart, and 
of my present feelings, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">will draw from her a more spontaneous, 
more natural, more </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gentle, less dignified, forgiveness.  
Tell her of my misery </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and my penitence--tell her that my 
heart was never inconstant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her, and if you will, that at this 
moment she is dearer </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to me than ever.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I will tell her all that is 
necessary to what may </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comparatively be called, your justification.  
But you have </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not explained to me the particular 
reason of your coming now, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor how you heard of her illness.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, 
I ran against Sir</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">John Middleton, and when he saw who 
I was--for the first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">time these two months--he spoke to 
me.--That he had cut</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me ever since my marriage, I had seen 
without surprise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or resentment.  Now, however, his 
good-natured, honest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stupid soul, full of indignation against 
me, and concern</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for your sister, could not resist 
the temptation of telling</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me what he knew ought to--though probably 
he did not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think it WOULD--vex me horridly.  
As bluntly as he could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">speak it, therefore, he told me that 
Marianne Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland--a 
letter that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">morning received from Mrs. Jennings 
declared her danger</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">most imminent--the Palmers are all 
gone off in a fright,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&amp;c.--I was too much shocked to 
be able to pass myself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">off as insensible even to the undiscerning 
Sir John.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His heart was softened in seeing mine 
suffer; and so much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his ill-will was done away, that 
when we parted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he almost shook me by the hand while 
he reminded me of an</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">old promise about a pointer puppy.  
What I felt on hearing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that your sister was dying--and dying 
too, believing me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, 
hating me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her latest moments--for how could 
I tell what horrid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">projects might not have been imputed?  
ONE person I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was sure would represent me as capable 
of any thing--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What I felt was dreadful!--My resolution 
was soon made,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and at eight o'clock this morning 
I was in my carriage.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Now you know all.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor made no answer.  Her thoughts 
were silently fixed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the irreparable injury which too 
early an independence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and its consequent habits of idleness, 
dissipation, and luxury,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had made in the mind, the character, 
the happiness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a man who, to every advantage of 
person and talents,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">united a disposition naturally open 
and honest, and a </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feeling, affectionate temper.  The 
world had made him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">extravagant and vain--Extravagance 
and vanity had made him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cold-hearted and selfish.  Vanity, 
while seeking its own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">guilty triumph at the expense of another, 
had involved</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him in a real attachment, which extravagance, 
or at least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its offspring, necessity, had required 
to be sacrificed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Each faulty propensity in leading 
him to evil, had led</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him likewise to punishment. The attachment, 
from which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against honour, against feeling, against 
every better interest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he had outwardly torn himself, now, 
when no longer allowable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">governed every thought; and the connection, 
for the sake</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of which he had, with little scruple, 
left her sister</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to misery, was likely to prove a source 
of unhappiness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to himself of a far more incurable 
nature.  From a reverie</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of this kind she was recalled at the 
end of some minutes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Willoughby, who, rousing himself 
from a reverie at least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">equally painful, started up in preparation 
for going, and said--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There is no use in staying here; 
I must be off.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Are you going back to town?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No--to Combe Magna.  I have 
business there;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from thence to town in a day or two.  
Good bye.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He held out his hand.  She could not 
refuse to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him hers's;--he pressed it with affection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And you DO think something better 
of me than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you did?&quot;--said he, letting it 
fall, and leaning against</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the mantel-piece as if forgetting 
he was to go.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor assured him that she did;--that 
she forgave,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pitied, wished him well--was even 
interested in his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happiness--and added some gentle counsel 
as to the behaviour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">most likely to promote it.  His answer 
was not very encouraging.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;As to that,&quot; said he, &quot;I 
must rub through the world</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as well as I can.  Domestic happiness 
is out of the question.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">If, however, I am allowed to think 
that you and yours feel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an interest in my fate and actions, 
it may be the means--it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may put me on my guard--at least, 
it may be something to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">live for.  Marianne to be sure is 
lost to me for ever.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Were I even by any blessed chance 
at liberty again--&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor stopped him with a reproof.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Well,&quot;--he replied--&quot;once 
more good bye. I shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now go away and live in dread of one 
event.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your sister's marriage.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are very wrong.  She can 
never be more lost</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to you than she is now.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But she will be gained by some 
one else.  And if</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that some one should be the very he 
whom, of all others,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I could least bear--but I will not 
stay to rob myself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all your compassionate goodwill, 
by shewing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that where I have most injured I can 
least forgive.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Good bye,--God bless you!&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And with these words, he almost ran 
out of the room.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 45</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, for some time after he left 
her, for some time </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even after the sound of his carriage 
had died away, remained </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too much oppressed by a crowd of ideas, 
widely differing in </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">themselves, but of which sadness was 
the general result,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to think even of her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby, he, whom only half an 
hour ago she had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">abhorred as the most worthless of 
men, Willoughby, in spite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all his faults, excited a degree 
of commiseration</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the sufferings produced by them, 
which made her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think of him as now separated for 
ever from her family,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a tenderness, a regret, rather 
in proportion, as she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">soon acknowledged within herself--to 
his wishes than to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his merits.  She felt that his influence 
over her mind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was heightened by circumstances which 
ought not in reason</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to have weight; by that person of 
uncommon attraction,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that open, affectionate, and lively 
manner which it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was no merit to possess; and by that 
still ardent love</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Marianne, which it was not even 
innocent to indulge.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But she felt that it was so, long, 
long before she could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feel his influence less.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When at last she returned to the unconscious 
Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she found her just awaking, refreshed 
by so long and sweet</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a sleep to the extent of her hopes. Elinor's 
heart was full.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The past, the present, the future, 
Willoughby's visit,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's safety, and her mother's 
expected arrival,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">threw her altogether into an agitation 
of spirits</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which kept off every indication of 
fatigue, and made</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her only fearful of betraying herself 
to her sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Short was the time, however, in which 
that fear could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affect her, for within half an hour 
after Willoughby's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">leaving the house, she was again called 
down stairs</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the sound of another carriage.--Eager 
to save her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother from every unnecessary moment's 
horrible suspense,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she ran immediately into the hall, 
and reached the outward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">door just in time to receive and support 
her as she entered it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they 
drew near the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">house had produced almost the conviction 
of Marianne's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being no more, had no voice to inquire 
after her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no voice even for Elinor; but SHE, 
waiting neither for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">salutation nor inquiry, instantly 
gave the joyful relief;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her mother, catching it with all 
her usual warmth,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was in a moment as much overcome by 
her happiness, as she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been before by her fears. She 
was supported into</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the drawing-room between her daughter 
and her friend;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and there, shedding tears of joy, 
though still unable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to speak, embraced Elinor again and 
again, turning from her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at intervals to press Colonel Brandon's 
hand, with a look</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which spoke at once her gratitude, 
and her conviction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his sharing with herself in the 
bliss of the moment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He shared it, however, in a silence 
even greater than her own.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered 
herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see Marianne was her first desire; 
and in two minutes she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was with her beloved child, rendered 
dearer to her than ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by absence, unhappiness, and danger.  
Elinor's delight,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she saw what each felt in the meeting, 
was only checked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by an apprehension of its robbing 
Marianne of farther sleep;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could 
be even prudent,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when the life of a child was at stake, 
and Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">satisfied in knowing her mother was 
near her, and conscious</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of being too weak for conversation, 
submitted readily to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">silence and quiet prescribed by every 
nurse around her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood WOULD sit up with her 
all night; and Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in compliance with her mother's entreaty, 
went to bed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But the rest, which one night entirely 
sleepless,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and many hours of the most wearing 
anxiety seemed to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">make requisite, was kept off by irritation 
of spirits.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby, &quot;poor Willoughby,&quot; 
as she now allowed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">herself to call him, was constantly 
in her thoughts; she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would not but have heard his vindication 
for the world,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and now blamed, now acquitted herself 
for having judged him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so harshly before.  But her promise 
of relating it to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister was invariably painful.  She 
dreaded the performance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it, dreaded what its effect on 
Marianne might be;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">doubted whether after such an explanation 
she could ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be happy with another; and for a moment 
wished Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a widower.  Then, remembering Colonel 
Brandon, reproved herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">felt that to HIS sufferings and his 
constancy far more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than to his rival's, the reward of 
her sister was due,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and wished any thing rather than Mrs. 
Willoughby's death.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The shock of Colonel Brandon's errand 
at Barton had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much softened to Mrs. Dashwood by 
her own previous alarm;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for so great was her uneasiness about 
Marianne, that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had already determined to set out 
for Cleveland on that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very day, without waiting for any 
further intelligence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and had so far settled her journey 
before his arrival,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that the Careys were then expected 
every moment to fetch</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Margaret away, as her mother was unwilling 
to take her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where there might be infection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne continued to mend every day, 
and the brilliant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cheerfulness of Mrs. Dashwood's looks 
and spirits proved</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her to be, as she repeatedly declared 
herself, one of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the happiest women in the world. Elinor 
could not hear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the declaration, nor witness its proofs 
without sometimes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wondering whether her mother ever 
recollected Edward.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Mrs. Dashwood, trusting to the 
temperate account</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her own disappointment which Elinor 
had sent her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was led away by the exuberance of 
her joy to think only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what would increase it.  Marianne 
was restored to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from a danger in which, as she now 
began to feel,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her own mistaken judgment in encouraging 
the unfortunate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attachment to Willoughby, had contributed 
to place her;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in her recovery she had yet another 
source of joy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unthought of by Elinor.  It was thus 
imparted to her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as any opportunity of private 
conference</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">between them occurred.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;At last we are alone.  My Elinor, 
you do not yet</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know all my happiness.  Colonel Brandon 
loves Marianne.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He has told me so himself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her daughter, feeling by turns both 
pleased and pained,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">surprised and not surprised, was all 
silent attention.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are never like me, dear 
Elinor, or I should</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wonder at your composure now. Had 
I sat down to wish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for any possible good to my family, 
I should have fixed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on Colonel Brandon's marrying one 
of you as the object</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">most desirable.  And I believe Marianne 
will be the most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happy with him of the two.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor was half inclined to ask her 
reason for thinking so,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">because satisfied that none founded 
on an impartial</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">consideration of their age, characters, 
or feelings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could be given;--but her mother must 
always be carried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">away by her imagination on any interesting 
subject,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and therefore instead of an inquiry, 
she passed it off with a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">smile.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He opened his whole heart to 
me yesterday as we travelled.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It came out quite unawares, quite 
undesignedly.  I, you may</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">well believe, could talk of nothing 
but my child;--he could </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not conceal his distress; I saw that 
it equalled my own, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he perhaps, thinking that mere 
friendship, as the world </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now goes, would not justify so warm 
a sympathy--or rather, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not thinking at all, I suppose--giving 
way to irresistible </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">feelings, made me acquainted with 
his earnest, tender, constant, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affection for Marianne. He has loved 
her, my Elinor, ever since </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the first moment of seeing her.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Here, however, Elinor perceived,--not 
the language,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not the professions of Colonel Brandon, 
but the natural</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">embellishments of her mother's active 
fancy, which fashioned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every thing delightful to her as it 
chose.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;His regard for her, infinitely 
surpassing anything</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Willoughby ever felt or feigned, 
as much more warm,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as more sincere or constant--which 
ever we are to call it--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has subsisted through all the knowledge 
of dear Marianne's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unhappy prepossession for that worthless 
young man!--and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without selfishness--without encouraging 
a hope!--could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he have seen her happy with another--Such 
a noble mind!--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such openness, such sincerity!--no 
one can be deceived</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in HIM.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Colonel Brandon's character,&quot; 
said Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;as an excellent man, is well 
established.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I know it is&quot;--replied 
her mother seriously, &quot;or</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after such a warning, I should be 
the last to encourage</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such affection, or even to be pleased 
by it.  But his coming</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for me as he did, with such active, 
such ready friendship,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is enough to prove him one of the 
worthiest of men.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;His character, however,&quot; 
answered Elinor, &quot;does not rest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on ONE act of kindness, to which his 
affection for Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were humanity out of the case, would 
have prompted him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons, 
he has been long</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and intimately known; they equally 
love and respect him;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and even my own knowledge of him, 
though lately acquired,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is very considerable; and so highly 
do I value and esteem him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that if Marianne can be happy with 
him, I shall be as ready</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as yourself to think our connection 
the greatest blessing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to us in the world.  What answer did 
you give him?--Did you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">allow him to hope?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Oh! my love, I could not then 
talk of hope to him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or to myself.  Marianne might at that 
moment be dying.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But he did not ask for hope or encouragement.  
His was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible 
effusion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to a soothing friend--not an application 
to a parent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Yet after a time I DID say, for at 
first I was quite </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">overcome--that if she lived, as I 
trusted she might,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my greatest happiness would lie in 
promoting their marriage;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and since our arrival, since our delightful 
security,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have repeated it to him more fully, 
have given him every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">encouragement in my power.  Time, 
a very little time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I tell him, will do everything;--Marianne's 
heart is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not to be wasted for ever on such 
a man as Willoughby.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His own merits must soon secure it.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;To judge from the Colonel's 
spirits, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you have not yet made him equally 
sanguine.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No.--He thinks Marianne's affection 
too deeply</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rooted for any change in it under 
a great length of time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and even supposing her heart again 
free, is too diffident</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of himself to believe, that with such 
a difference of age</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and disposition he could ever attach 
her.  There, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he is quite mistaken.  His age is 
only so much beyond</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hers as to be an advantage, as to 
make his character and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">principles fixed;--and his disposition, 
I am well convinced,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is exactly the very one to make your 
sister happy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And his person, his manners too, are 
all in his favour.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">My partiality does not blind me; he 
certainly is not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so handsome as Willoughby--but at 
the same time,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">there is something much more pleasing 
in his countenance.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">There was always a something,--if 
you remember,--in Willoughby's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">eyes at times, which I did not like.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could NOT remember it;--but 
her mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without waiting for her assent, continued,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And his manners, the Colonel's 
manners are not only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more pleasing to me than Willoughby's 
ever were, but they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are of a kind I well know to be more 
solidly attaching</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Marianne.  Their gentleness, their 
genuine attention</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to other people, and their manly unstudied 
simplicity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is much more accordant with her real 
disposition, than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the liveliness--often artificial, 
and often ill-timed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the other.  I am very sure myself, 
that had Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">turned out as really amiable, as he 
has proved himself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the contrary, Marianne would yet never 
have been so happy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with HIM, as she will be with Colonel 
Brandon.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She paused.--Her daughter could not 
quite agree</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with her, but her dissent was not 
heard, and therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gave no offence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;At Delaford, she will be within 
an easy distance of me,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">added Mrs. Dashwood, &quot;even if 
I remain at Barton; and in all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">probability,--for I hear it is a large 
village,--indeed there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">certainly MUST be some small house 
or cottage close by,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that would suit us quite as well as 
our present situation.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor Elinor!--here was a new scheme 
for getting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her to Delaford!--but her spirit was 
stubborn.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;His fortune too!--for at my 
time of life you know,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">everybody cares about THAT;--and though 
I neither know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor desire to know, what it really 
is, I am sure it must be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a good one.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Here they were interrupted by the 
entrance of a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">third person, and Elinor withdrew 
to think it all over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in private, to wish success to her 
friend, and yet</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in wishing it, to feel a pang for 
Willoughby.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 46</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's illness, though weakening 
in its kind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had not been long enough to make her 
recovery slow;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and with youth, natural strength, 
and her mother's presence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as 
to enable her to remove,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">within four days after the arrival 
of the latter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room.  
When there, at her own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">particular request, for she was impatient 
to pour forth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her thanks to him for fetching her 
mother, Colonel Brandon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was invited to visit her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His emotion on entering the room, 
in seeing her altered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">looks, and in receiving the pale hand 
which she immediately</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">held out to him, was such, as, in 
Elinor's conjecture,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must arise from something more than 
his affection for Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or the consciousness of its being 
known to others;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she soon discovered in his melancholy 
eye and varying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">complexion as he looked at her sister, 
the probable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">recurrence of many past scenes of 
misery to his mind,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">brought back by that resemblance between 
Marianne and Eliza</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">already acknowledged, and now strengthened 
by the hollow eye,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the sickly skin, the posture of reclining 
weakness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar 
obligation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of 
what passed than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her daughter, but with a mind very 
differently influenced,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and therefore watching to very different 
effect,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">saw nothing in the Colonel's behaviour 
but what arose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the most simple and self-evident 
sensations, while in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the actions and words of Marianne 
she persuaded herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to think that something more than 
gratitude already dawned.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">At the end of another day or two, 
Marianne growing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">visibly stronger every twelve hours, 
Mrs. Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">urged equally by her own and her daughter's 
wishes,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">began to talk of removing to Barton.  
On HER measures</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">depended those of her two friends; 
Mrs. Jennings could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' 
stay; and Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon was soon brought, by their 
united request,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to consider his own abode there as 
equally determinate,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if not equally indispensable.  At 
his and Mrs. Jennings's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood 
was prevailed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on to accept the use of his carriage 
on her journey back,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the better accommodation of her 
sick child; and the Colonel,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at the joint invitation of Mrs. Dashwood 
and Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whose active good-nature made her 
friendly and hospitable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for other people as well as herself, 
engaged with pleasure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, 
in the course</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a few weeks.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The day of separation and departure 
arrived;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne, after taking so particular 
and lengthened</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly 
grateful, so full</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of respect and kind wishes as seemed 
due to her own heart</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from a secret acknowledgment of past 
inattention, and bidding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality 
of a friend,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was carefully assisted by him into 
the carriage, of which he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed anxious that she should engross 
at least half.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, 
and the others</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were left by themselves, to talk of 
the travellers,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and feel their own dullness, till 
Mrs. Jennings was summoned</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her chaise to take comfort in the 
gossip of her maid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the loss of her two young companions; 
and Colonel Brandon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately afterwards took his solitary 
way to Delaford.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The Dashwoods were two days on the 
road, and Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">bore her journey on both, without 
essential fatigue.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Every thing that the most zealous 
affection, the most</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">solicitous care could do to render 
her comfortable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was the office of each watchful companion, 
and each</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">found their reward in her bodily ease, 
and her calmness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of spirits.  To Elinor, the observation 
of the latter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was particularly grateful.  She, who 
had seen her week</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after week so constantly suffering, 
oppressed by anguish</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of heart which she had neither courage 
to speak of,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor fortitude to conceal, now saw 
with a joy, which no other</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could equally share, an apparent composure 
of mind, which,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in being the result as she trusted 
of serious reflection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must eventually lead her to contentment 
and cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As they approached Barton, indeed, 
and entered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on scenes of which every field and 
every tree brought</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some peculiar, some painful recollection, 
she grew silent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and thoughtful, and turning away her 
face from their notice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sat earnestly gazing through the window. But 
here,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could neither wonder nor blame; 
and when she saw,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she assisted Marianne from the 
carriage, that she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been crying, she saw only an emotion 
too natural</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in itself to raise any thing less 
tender than pity,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in its unobtrusiveness entitled 
to praise.  In the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">whole of her subsequent manner, she 
traced the direction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a mind awakened to reasonable exertion; 
for no sooner</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had they entered their common sitting-room, 
than Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">turned her eyes around it with a look 
of resolute firmness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as if determined at once to accustom 
herself to the sight</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of every object with which the remembrance 
of Willoughby could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be connected.--She said little, but 
every sentence aimed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at cheerfulness, and though a sigh 
sometimes escaped her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it never passed away without the atonement 
of a smile.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After dinner she would try her piano-forte. 
She went to it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the music on which her eye first 
rested was an opera,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">procured for her by Willoughby, containing 
some of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">favourite duets, and bearing on its 
outward leaf her own name</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his hand-writing.--That would not 
do.--She shook her head,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">put the music aside, and after running 
over the keys</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for a minute, complained of feebleness 
in her fingers,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and closed the instrument again; declaring 
however with firmness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she did so, that she should in 
future practice much.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The next morning produced no abatement 
in these</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">happy symptoms.  On the contrary, 
with a mind and body</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">alike strengthened by rest, she looked 
and spoke with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more genuine spirit, anticipating 
the pleasure of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Margaret's return, and talking of 
the dear family party</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which would then be restored, of their 
mutual pursuits</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and cheerful society, as the only 
happiness worth a wish.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;When the weather is settled, 
and I have recovered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my strength,&quot; said she, &quot;we 
will take long walks together</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every day.  We will walk to the farm 
at the edge of the down,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and see how the children go on; we 
will walk to Sir John's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">new plantations at Barton Cross, and 
the Abbeyland;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and we will often go the old ruins 
of the Priory,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and try to trace its foundations as 
far as we are told</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they once reached.  I know we shall 
be happy.  I know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the summer will pass happily away.  
I mean never to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">later in rising than six, and from 
that time till dinner</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I shall divide every moment between 
music and reading.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have formed my plan, and am determined 
to enter on a course</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of serious study. Our own library 
is too well known to me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be resorted to for any thing beyond 
mere amusement.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But there are many works well worth 
reading at the Park;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and there are others of more modern 
production which I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know I can borrow of Colonel Brandon.  
By reading only six</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hours a-day, I shall gain in the course 
of a twelve-month</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a great deal of instruction which 
I now feel myself to want.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor honoured her for a plan which 
originated</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so nobly as this; though smiling to 
see the same eager</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fancy which had been leading her to 
the extreme of languid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">indolence and selfish repining, now 
at work in introducing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">excess into a scheme of such rational 
employment and virtuous</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">self-control. Her smile however changed 
to a sigh when she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">remembered that promise to Willoughby 
was yet unfulfilled,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and feared she had that to communicate 
which might again</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unsettle the mind of Marianne, and 
ruin at least for a time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">this fair prospect of busy tranquillity.  
Willing therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to delay the evil hour, she resolved 
to wait till her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sister's health were more secure, 
before she appointed it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But the resolution was made only to 
be broken.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne had been two or three days 
at home, before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the weather was fine enough for an 
invalid like herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to venture out.  But at last a soft, 
genial morning appeared;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such as might tempt the daughter's 
wishes and the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother's confidence; and Marianne, 
leaning on Elinor's arm,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was authorised to walk as long as 
she could without fatigue,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the lane before the house.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The sisters set out at a pace, slow 
as the feebleness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Marianne in an exercise hitherto 
untried since her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">illness required;--and they had advanced 
only so far</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beyond the house as to admit a full 
view of the hill,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the important hill behind, when pausing 
with her eyes </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">turned towards it, Marianne calmly 
said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;There, exactly there,&quot;--pointing 
with one hand,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;on that projecting mound,--there 
I fell; and there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I first saw Willoughby.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her voice sunk with the word, but 
presently reviving she added,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am thankful to find that I 
can look with so little pain </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the spot!--shall we ever talk on 
that subject, Elinor?&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hesitatingly it was said.--&quot;Or 
will it be wrong?--I can talk </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it now, I hope, as I ought to do.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor tenderly invited her to be 
open.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;As for regret,&quot; said Marianne, 
&quot;I have done with that,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as far as HE is concerned.  I do not 
mean to talk to you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what my feelings have been for 
him, but what they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are NOW.--At present, if I could be 
satisfied on one point,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if I could be allowed to think that 
he was not ALWAYS</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acting a part, not ALWAYS deceiving 
me;--but above all,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if I could be assured that he never 
was so VERY wicked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as my fears have sometimes fancied 
him, since the story</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of that unfortunate girl&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She stopt. Elinor joyfully treasured 
her words </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she answered,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;If you could be assured of that, 
you think you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should be easy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes. My peace of mind is doubly 
involved in it;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for not only is it horrible to suspect 
a person, who has</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been what HE has been to ME, of such 
designs,--but what must </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it make me appear to myself?--What 
in a situation like mine,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but a most shamefully unguarded affection 
could expose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me to&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;How then,&quot; asked her sister, 
&quot;would you account</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for his behaviour?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I would suppose him,--Oh, how 
gladly would I suppose him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">only fickle, very, very fickle.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor said no more. She was debating 
within herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the eligibility of beginning her 
story directly,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or postponing it till Marianne were 
in stronger health;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and they crept on for a few minutes 
in silence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I am not wishing him too much 
good,&quot; said Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at last with a sigh,&quot;when I wish 
his secret reflections</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may be no more unpleasant than my 
own.  He will suffer</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enough in them.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do you compare your conduct 
with his?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No. I compare it with what it 
ought to have been;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I compare it with yours.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Our situations have borne little 
resemblance.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;They have borne more than our 
conduct.--Do not,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my dearest Elinor, let your kindness 
defend what I know</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your judgment must censure.  My illness 
has made me think--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It has given me leisure and calmness 
for serious recollection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Long before I was enough recovered 
to talk, I was perfectly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">able to reflect.  I considered the 
past: I saw in my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">own behaviour, since the beginning 
of our acquaintance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with him last autumn, nothing but 
a series of imprudence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">towards myself, and want of kindness 
to others.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I saw that my own feelings had prepared 
my sufferings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that my want of fortitude under 
them had almost led</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me to the grave.  My illness, I well 
knew, had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entirely brought on by myself by such 
negligence of my</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">own health, as I had felt even at 
the time to be wrong.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Had I died,--it would have been self-destruction. 
I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">did not know my danger till the danger 
was removed;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but with such feelings as these reflections 
gave me,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I wonder at my recovery,--wonder that 
the very eagerness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of my desire to live, to have time 
for atonement to my God,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to you all, did not kill me at 
once.  Had I died,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in what peculiar misery should I have 
left you, my nurse,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my friend, my sister!--You, who had 
seen all the fretful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">selfishness of my latter days; who 
had known all the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">murmurings of my heart!--How should 
I have lived in YOUR</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">remembrance!--My mother too! How could 
you have consoled</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her!--I cannot express my own abhorrence 
of myself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Whenever I looked towards the past, 
I saw some duty neglected,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or some failing indulged. Every body 
seemed injured by me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The kindness, the unceasing kindness 
of Mrs. Jennings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had repaid with ungrateful contempt.  
To the Middletons,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every 
common acquaintance even,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had been insolent and unjust; with 
a heart hardened</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against their merits, and a temper 
irritated by their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very attention.--To John, to Fanny,--yes, 
even to them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">little as they deserve, I had given 
less than their due.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But you,--you above all, above my 
mother, had been wronged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by me. I, and only I, knew your heart 
and its sorrows;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yet to what did it influence me?--not 
to any compassion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that could benefit you or myself.--Your 
example was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">before me; but to what avail?--Was 
I more considerate</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of you and your comfort? Did I imitate 
your forbearance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or lessen your restraints, by taking 
any part in those</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">offices of general complaisance or 
particular gratitude</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which you had hitherto been left to 
discharge alone?--No;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not less when I knew you to be unhappy, 
than when I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had believed you at ease, did I turn 
away from every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely 
allowing sorrow</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to exist but with me, regretting only 
THAT heart</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which had deserted and wronged me, 
and leaving you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for or I professed an unbounded affection, 
to be miserable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for my sake.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Here ceased the rapid flow of her 
self-reproving spirit;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though 
too honest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to flatter, gave her instantly that 
praise and support</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which her frankness and her contrition 
so well deserved.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne pressed her hand and replied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You are very good.--The future 
must be my proof.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I have laid down my plan, and if I 
am capable of adhering</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to it--my feelings shall be governed 
and my temper improved.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They shall no longer worry others, 
nor torture myself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I shall now live solely for my family.  
You, my mother,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Margaret, must henceforth be all 
the world to me;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you will share my affections entirely 
between you.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&gt;From you, from my home, I shall 
never again have the smallest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">incitement to move; and if I do mix 
in other society,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it will be only to shew that my spirit 
is humbled,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">my heart amended, and that I can practise 
the civilities,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the lesser duties of life, with gentleness 
and forbearance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As for Willoughby--to say that I shall 
soon or that I shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ever forget him, would be idle.  His 
remembrance can be overcome</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by no change of circumstances or opinions. But 
it shall</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be regulated, it shall be checked 
by religion, by reason,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by constant employment.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She paused--and added in a low voice, 
&quot;If I could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but know HIS heart, everything would 
become easy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, who had now been for some 
time reflecting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on the propriety or impropriety of 
speedily hazarding</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her narration, without feeling at 
all nearer decision than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at first, heard this; and perceiving 
that as reflection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">did nothing, resolution must do all, 
soon found herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">leading to the fact.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She managed the recital, as she hoped, 
with address;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">prepared her anxious listener with 
caution; related simply</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and honestly the chief points on which 
Willoughby</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">grounded his apology; did justice 
to his repentance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and softened only his protestations 
of present regard.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne said not a word.--She trembled, 
her eyes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were fixed on the ground, and her 
lips became whiter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than even sickness had left them.  
A thousand inquiries</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sprung up from her heart, but she 
dared not urge one.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She caught every syllable with panting 
eagerness; her hand,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unknowingly to herself, closely pressed 
her sister's, and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">tears covered her cheeks.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, dreading her being tired, 
led her towards home;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and till they reached the door of 
the cottage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">easily conjecturing what her curiosity 
must be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though no question was suffered to 
speak it, talked of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing but Willoughby, and their 
conversation together;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and was carefully minute in every 
particular of speech</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and look, where minuteness could be 
safely indulged.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">As soon as they entered the house, 
Marianne with a kiss</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of gratitude and these two words just 
articulate through</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her tears,&quot;Tell mama,&quot; withdrew 
from her sister and </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">walked slowly up stairs.  Elinor would 
not attempt </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to disturb a solitude so reasonable 
as what she now sought;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging 
its result,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a resolution of reviving the subject 
again,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should Marianne fail to do it, she 
turned into the parlour</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to fulfill her parting injunction.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 47</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved 
the vindication</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her former favourite.  She rejoiced 
in his being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cleared from some part of his imputed 
guilt;--she was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sorry for him;--she wished him happy.  
But the feelings</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the past could not be recalled.--Nothing 
could restore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him with a faith unbroken--a character 
unblemished,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Marianne.  Nothing could do away 
the knowledge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of what the latter had suffered through 
his means,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor remove the guilt of his conduct 
towards Eliza.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nothing could replace him, therefore, 
in her former esteem,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor injure the interests of Colonel 
Brandon.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her daughter, 
heard Willoughby's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">story from himself--had she witnessed 
his distress,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and been under the influence of his 
countenance and his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">manner, it is probable that her compassion 
would have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been greater.  But it was neither 
in Elinor's power,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor in her wish, to rouse such feelings 
in another, by her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">retailed explanation, as had at first 
been called forth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in herself.  Reflection had given 
calmness to her judgment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby's 
deserts;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she wished, therefore, to declare 
only the simple truth,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and lay open such facts as were really 
due to his character,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without any embellishment of tenderness 
to lead the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fancy astray.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In the evening, when they were all 
three together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne began voluntarily to speak 
of him again;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but that it was not without an effort, 
the restless,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unquiet thoughtfulness in which she 
had been for some time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">previously sitting--her rising colour, 
as she spoke,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her unsteady voice, plainly shewed.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I wish to assure you both,&quot; 
said she,&quot;that I see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every thing--as you can desire me 
to do.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted 
her instantly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with soothing tenderness, had not 
Elinor, who really wished</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to hear her sister's unbiased opinion, 
by an eager sign,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">engaged her silence. Marianne slowly 
continued--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is a great relief to me--what 
Elinor told</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me this morning--I have now heard 
exactly what I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wished to hear.&quot;--For some moments 
her voice was lost;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but recovering herself, she added, 
and with greater</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">calmness than before--&quot;I am now 
perfectly satisfied,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I wish for no change.  I never could 
have been happy </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with him, after knowing, as sooner 
or later I must </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have known, all this.--I should have 
had no confidence, </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no esteem.  Nothing could have done 
it away to my feelings.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I know it--I know it,&quot; 
cried her mother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Happy with a man of libertine 
practices!--With one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who so injured the peace of the dearest 
of our friends,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the best of men!--No--my Marianne 
has not a heart</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be made happy with such a man!--Her 
conscience, her </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sensitive counscience, would have 
felt all that the </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conscience of her husband ought to 
have felt.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne sighed, and repeated, &quot;I 
wish for no change.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You consider the matter,&quot; 
said Elinor,&quot;exactly as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a good mind and a sound understanding 
must consider it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I dare say you perceive, as well 
as myself, not only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in this, but in many other circumstances, 
reason enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be convinced that your marriage 
must have involved you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in many certain troubles and disappointments, 
in which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you would have been poorly supported 
by an affection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on his side, much less certain.  Had 
you married,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you must have been always poor.  His 
expensiveness is</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">acknowledged even by himself, and 
his whole conduct declares</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that self-denial is a word hardly 
understood by him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His demands and your inexperience 
together, on a small,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very small income, must have brought 
on distresses which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would not be the LESS grievous to 
you, from having been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entirely unknown and unthought of 
before.  YOUR sense</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of honour and honesty would have led 
you, I know,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when aware of your situation, to attempt 
all the economy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that would appear to you possible: 
and, perhaps, as long</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as your frugality retrenched only 
on your own comfort,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you might have been suffered to practice 
it, but beyond that--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and how little could the utmost of 
your single management</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">do to stop the ruin which had begun 
before your marriage?--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Beyond THAT, had you endeavoured, 
however reasonably,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to abridge HIS enjoyments, is it not 
to be feared, that instead</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of prevailing on feelings so selfish 
to consent to it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">you would have lessened your own influence 
on his heart,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and made him regret the connection 
which had involved him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in such difficulties?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne's lips quivered, and she 
repeated the word</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Selfish?&quot; in a tone that 
implied--&quot;do you really think</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him selfish?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;The whole of his behaviour,&quot; 
replied Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;from the beginning to the end 
of the affair, has been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">grounded on selfishness.  It was selfishness 
which first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made him sport with your affections; 
which afterwards,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when his own were engaged, made him 
delay the confession</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of it, and which finally carried him 
from Barton.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His own enjoyment, or his own ease, 
was, in every particular,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his ruling principle.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It is very true.  MY happiness 
never was his object.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;At present,&quot; continued 
Elinor, &quot;he regrets what he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has done.  And why does he regret 
it?--Because he finds</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it has not answered towards himself.  
It has not made</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him happy. His circumstances are now 
unembarrassed--he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">suffers from no evil of that kind; 
and he thinks only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he has married a woman of a less 
amiable temper</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">than yourself.  But does it follow 
that had he married you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he would have been happy?--The inconveniences 
would have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been different. He would then have 
suffered under the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pecuniary distresses which, because 
they are removed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he now reckons as nothing.  He would 
have had a wife</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of whose temper he could make no complaint, 
but he would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been always necessitous--always 
poor; and probably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would soon have learned to rank the 
innumerable comforts</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a clear estate and good income 
as of far more importance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even to domestic happiness, than the 
mere temper of a wife.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I have not a doubt of it,&quot; 
said Marianne;&quot;and I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have nothing to regret--nothing but 
my own folly.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Rather say your mother's imprudence, 
my child,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Mrs. Dashwood;&quot;SHE must 
be answerable.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne would not let her proceed;--and 
Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">satisfied that each felt their own 
error, wished to avoid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any survey of the past that might 
weaken her sister's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spirits; she, therefore, pursuing 
the first subject,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately continued,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;One observation may, I think, 
be fairly drawn from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the whole of the story--that all Willoughby's 
difficulties</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have arisen from the first offence 
against virtue, in his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaviour to Eliza Williams.  That 
crime has been the origin</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of every lesser one, and of all his 
present discontents.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne assented most feelingly to 
the remark;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her mother was led by it to an 
enumeration of Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon's injuries and merits, warm 
as friendship</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and design could unitedly dictate.  
Her daughter did</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not look, however, as if much of it 
were heard by her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor, according to her expectation, 
saw on the two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or three following days, that Marianne 
did not continue</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to gain strength as she had done; 
but while her resolution</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was unsubdued, and she still tried 
to appear cheerful</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and easy, her sister could safely 
trust to the effect</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of time upon her health.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Margaret returned, and the family 
were again all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">restored to each other, again quietly 
settled at the cottage;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and if not pursuing their usual studies 
with quite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so much vigour as when they first 
came to Barton,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at least planning a vigorous prosecution 
of them in future.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor grew impatient for some tidings 
of Edward.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She had heard nothing of him since 
her leaving London,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing new of his plans, nothing 
certain even of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">present abode.  Some letters had passed 
between her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her brother, in consequence of 
Marianne's illness;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in the first of John's, there 
had been this sentence:--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;We know nothing of our unfortunate 
Edward, and can make no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enquiries on so prohibited a subject, 
but conclude him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be still at Oxford;&quot; which 
was all the intelligence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Edward afforded her by the correspondence, 
for his name</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was not even mentioned in any of the 
succeeding letters.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was not doomed, however, to be 
long in ignorance of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his measures.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their man-servant had been sent one 
morning to Exeter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on business; and when, as he waited 
at table, he had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">satisfied the inquiries of his mistress 
as to the event</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his errand, this was his voluntary 
communication--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I suppose you know, ma'am, that 
Mr. Ferrars is married.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne gave a violent start, fixed 
her eyes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">upon Elinor, saw her turning pale, 
and fell back in her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood, 
whose eyes, as she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">answered the servant's inquiry, had 
intuitively taken</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the same direction, was shocked to 
perceive by Elinor's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">countenance how much she really suffered, 
and a moment </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">afterwards, alike distressed by Marianne's 
situation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">knew not on which child to bestow 
her principal attention.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The servant, who saw only that Miss 
Marianne was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">taken ill, had sense enough to call 
one of the maids,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who, with Mrs. Dashwood's assistance, 
supported her into</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the other room.  By that time, Marianne 
was rather better,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and her mother leaving her to the 
care of Margaret</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the maid, returned to Elinor, 
who, though still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">much disordered, had so far recovered 
the use of her reason</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and voice as to be just beginning 
an inquiry of Thomas,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as to the source of his intelligence.  
Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">immediately took all that trouble 
on herself; and Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had the benefit of the information 
without the exertion</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of seeking it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Who told you that Mr. Ferrars 
was married, Thomas?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma'am, 
this morning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Exeter, and his lady too, Miss 
Steele as was.  They was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">stopping in a chaise at the door of 
the New London Inn,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as I went there with a message from 
Sally at the Park</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her brother, who is one of the 
post-boys. I happened</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to look up as I went by the chaise, 
and so I see directly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was the youngest Miss Steele; so 
I took off my hat,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she knew me and called to me, 
and inquired after you,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ma'am, and the young ladies, especially 
Miss Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and bid me I should give her compliments 
and Mr. Ferrars's,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their best compliments and service, 
and how sorry they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was they had not time to come on and 
see you, but they was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in a great hurry to go forwards, for 
they was going further</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">down for a little while, but howsever, 
when they come back,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they'd make sure to come and see you.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;But did she tell you she was 
married, Thomas?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, ma'am. She smiled, and 
said how she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had changed her name since she was 
in these parts.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was always a very affable and 
free-spoken young lady,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and very civil behaved.  So, I made 
free to wish her joy.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage 
with her?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, ma'am, I just see him leaning 
back in it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but he did not look up;--he never 
was a gentleman much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for talking.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's heart could easily account 
for his not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">putting himself forward; and Mrs. 
Dashwood probably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">found the same explanation.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Was there no one else in the 
carriage?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, ma'am, only they two.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Do you know where they came 
from?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;They come straight from town, 
as Miss Lucy--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars told me.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And are they going farther westward?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, ma'am--but not to bide 
long.  They will soon</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be back again, and then they'd be 
sure and call here.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her daughter;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Elinor knew better than to expect 
them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She recognised the whole of Lucy in 
the message, and was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">very confident that Edward would never 
come near them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She observed in a low voice, to her 
mother, that they</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were probably going down to Mr. Pratt's, 
near Plymouth.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Thomas's intelligence seemed over.  
Elinor looked</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as if she wished to hear more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did you see them off, before 
you came away?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, ma'am--the horses were just 
coming out, but I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could not bide any longer; I was afraid 
of being late.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes, ma'am, she said how she 
was very well;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to my mind she was always a very 
handsome young</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">lady--and she seemed vastly contented.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other 
question,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Thomas and the tablecloth, now 
alike needless,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were soon afterwards dismissed.  Marianne 
had already sent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to say, that she should eat nothing 
more.  Mrs. Dashwood's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Elinor's appetites were equally 
lost, and Margaret</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might think herself very well off, 
that with so much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">uneasiness as both her sisters had 
lately experienced,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so much reason as they had often had 
to be careless</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of their meals, she had never been 
obliged to go without</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her dinner before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When the dessert and the wine were 
arranged,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor were 
left by themselves,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they remained long together in a similarity 
of thoughtfulness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and silence.  Mrs. Dashwood feared 
to hazard any remark,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and ventured not to offer consolation.  
She now found</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she had erred in relying on Elinor's 
representation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of herself; and justly concluded that 
every thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been expressly softened at the 
time, to spare her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from an increase of unhappiness, suffering 
as she then</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had suffered for Marianne.  She found 
that she had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">misled by the careful, the considerate 
attention of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her daughter, to think the attachment, 
which once she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had so well understood, much slighter 
in reality, than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had been wont to believe, or than 
it was now proved</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be.  She feared that under this 
persuasion she had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been unjust, inattentive, nay, almost 
unkind, to her Elinor;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Marianne's affliction, because 
more acknowledged,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more immediately before her, had too 
much engrossed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her tenderness, and led her away to 
forget that in Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she might have a daughter suffering 
almost as much,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">certainly with less self-provocation, 
and greater fortitude.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 48</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor now found the difference between 
the expectation</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of an unpleasant event, however certain 
the mind may be told</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to consider it, and certainty itself.  
She now found, that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in spite of herself, she had always 
admitted a hope,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while Edward remained single, that 
something would occur</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to prevent his marrying Lucy; that 
some resolution of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his own, some mediation of friends, 
or some more eligible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opportunity of establishment for the 
lady, would arise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to assist the happiness of all.  But 
he was now married;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she condemned her heart for the 
lurking flattery,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which so much heightened the pain 
of the intelligence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">That he should be married soon, before 
(as she imagined)</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he could be in orders, and consequently 
before he could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be in possession of the living, surprised 
her a little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at first.  But she soon saw how likely 
it was that Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her self-provident care, in her 
haste to secure him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should overlook every thing but the 
risk of delay.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were married, married in town, 
and now hastening</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">down to her uncle's.  What had Edward 
felt on being within</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">four miles from Barton, on seeing 
her mother's servant,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on hearing Lucy's message!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They would soon, she supposed, be 
settled at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Delaford.--Delaford,--that place in 
which so much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conspired to give her an interest; 
which she wished</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to be acquainted with, and yet desired 
to avoid.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She saw them in an instant in their 
parsonage-house; saw</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in Lucy, the active, contriving manager, 
uniting at once</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a desire of smart appearance with 
the utmost frugality,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and ashamed to be suspected of half 
her economical practices;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pursuing her own interest in every 
thought, courting the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. 
Jennings, and of every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">wealthy friend.  In Edward--she knew 
not what she saw,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor what she wished to see;--happy 
or unhappy,--nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pleased her; she turned away her head 
from every sketch of him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor flattered herself that some 
one of their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">connections in London would write 
to them to announce</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the event, and give farther particulars,--but 
day after</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">day passed off, and brought no letter, 
no tidings.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Though uncertain that any one were 
to blame, she found</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fault with every absent friend.  They 
were all thoughtless</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or indolent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;When do you write to Colonel 
Brandon, ma'am?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was an inquiry which sprung from the 
impatience</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her mind to have something going 
on.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I wrote to him, my love, last 
week, and rather</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expect to see, than to hear from him 
again.  I earnestly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pressed his coming to us, and should 
not be surprised</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to see him walk in today or tomorrow, 
or any day.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This was gaining something, something 
to look forward to.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon must have some information 
to give.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Scarcely had she so determined it, 
when the figure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a man on horseback drew her eyes 
to the window.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He stopt at their gate.  It was a 
gentleman, it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was Colonel Brandon himself.  Now 
she could hear more;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she trembled in expectation of 
it.  But--it was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">NOT Colonel Brandon--neither his air--nor 
his height.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Were it possible, she must say it 
must be Edward.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She looked again.  He had just dismounted;--she 
could not be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mistaken,--it WAS Edward.  She moved 
away and sat down.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;He comes from Mr. Pratt's purposely 
to see us.  I WILL be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">calm; I WILL be mistress of myself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In a moment she perceived that the 
others were likewise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">aware of the mistake. She saw her 
mother and Marianne</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">change colour; saw them look at herself, 
and whisper</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a few sentences to each other.  She 
would have given</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the world to be able to speak--and 
to make them understand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that she hoped no coolness, no slight, 
would appear</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in their behaviour to him;--but she 
had no utterance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and was obliged to leave all to their 
own discretion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Not a syllable passed aloud.  They 
all waited</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in silence for the appearance of their 
visitor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His footsteps were heard along the 
gravel path; in a moment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he was in the passage, and in another 
he was before them.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His countenance, as he entered the 
room, was not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too happy, even for Elinor. His complexion 
was white</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with agitation, and he looked as if 
fearful of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reception, and conscious that he merited 
no kind one.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, 
as she trusted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the wishes of that daughter, by 
whom she then meant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the warmth of her heart to be guided 
in every thing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">met with a look of forced complacency, 
gave him her hand,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and wished him joy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He coloured, and stammered out an 
unintelligible reply.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's lips had moved with her mother's, 
and, when the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">moment of action was over, she wished 
that she had shaken</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hands with him too.  But it was then 
too late, and with a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">countenance meaning to be open, she 
sat down again</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and talked of the weather.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne had retreated as much as 
possible</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out of sight, to conceal her distress; 
and Margaret,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">understanding some part, but not the 
whole of the case,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thought it incumbent on her to be 
dignified, and therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">took a seat as far from him as she 
could, and maintained</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a strict silence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">When Elinor had ceased to rejoice 
in the dryness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the season, a very awful pause 
took place.  It was put</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt 
obliged to hope that he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had left Mrs. Ferrars very well.  
In a hurried manner,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Another pause.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor resolving to exert herself, 
though fearing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the sound of her own voice, now said,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;At Longstaple!&quot; he replied, 
with an air of surprise.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No, my mother is in town.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I meant,&quot; said Elinor, 
taking up some work from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the table, &quot;to inquire for Mrs. 
EDWARD Ferrars.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She dared not look up;--but her mother 
and Marianne both</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">turned their eyes on him.  He coloured, 
seemed perplexed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">looked doubtingly, and, after some 
hesitation, said,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps you mean--my brother--you 
mean Mrs.--Mrs.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ROBERT Ferrars.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mrs. Robert Ferrars!&quot;--was 
repeated by Marianne and her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother in an accent of the utmost 
amazement;--and though</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could not speak, even HER eyes 
were fixed on him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the same impatient wonder.  He 
rose from his seat,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and walked to the window, apparently 
from not knowing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what to do; took up a pair of scissors 
that lay there,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and while spoiling both them and their 
sheath by cutting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the latter to pieces as he spoke, 
said, in a hurried voice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Perhaps you do not know--you 
may not have heard</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that my brother is lately married 
to--to the youngest--to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Lucy Steele.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His words were echoed with unspeakable 
astonishment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by all but Elinor, who sat with her 
head leaning over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her work, in a state of such agitation 
as made her hardly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">know where she was.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Yes,&quot; said he, &quot;they 
were married last week,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and are now at Dawlish.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor could sit it no longer.  She 
almost ran</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">out of the room, and as soon as the 
door was closed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">burst into tears of joy, which at 
first she thought would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">never cease.  Edward, who had till 
then looked any where,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rather than at her, saw her hurry 
away, and perhaps saw--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or even heard, her emotion; for immediately 
afterwards</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he fell into a reverie, which no remarks, 
no inquiries,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no affectionate address of Mrs. Dashwood 
could penetrate,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and at last, without saying a word, 
quitted the room,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and walked out towards the village--leaving 
the others</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the greatest astonishment and perplexity 
on a change</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his situation, so wonderful and 
so sudden;--a perplexity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which they had no means of lessening 
but by their</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">own conjectures.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 49</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Unaccountable, however, as the circumstances 
of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">release might appear to the whole 
family, it was certain</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Edward was free; and to what 
purpose that freedom would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be employed was easily pre-determined 
by all;--for after</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">experiencing the blessings of ONE 
imprudent engagement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">contracted without his mother's consent, 
as he had already</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">done for more than four years, nothing 
less could be expected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of him in the failure of THAT, than 
the immediate contraction</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of another.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His errand at Barton, in fact, was 
a simple one.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was only to ask Elinor to marry 
him;--and considering</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that he was not altogether inexperienced 
in such a question,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it might be strange that he should 
feel so uncomfortable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the present case as he really did, 
so much in need of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">encouragement and fresh air.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">How soon he had walked himself into 
the proper</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">resolution, however, how soon an opportunity 
of exercising</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it occurred, in what manner he expressed 
himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and how he was received, need not 
be particularly told.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This only need be said;--that when 
they all sat down to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">table at four o'clock, about three 
hours after his arrival,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he had secured his lady, engaged her 
mother's consent,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and was not only in the rapturous 
profession of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the lover, but, in the reality of 
reason and truth,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one of the happiest of men.  His situation 
indeed was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more than commonly joyful.  He had 
more than the ordinary</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">triumph of accepted love to swell 
his heart, and raise</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his spirits.  He was released without 
any reproach</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to himself, from an entanglement which 
had long formed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his misery, from a woman whom he had 
long ceased to love;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and elevated at once to that security 
with another,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which he must have thought of almost 
with despair,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as soon as he had learnt to consider 
it with desire.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was brought, not from doubt or 
suspense, but from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">misery to happiness;--and the change 
was openly spoken</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in such a genuine, flowing, grateful 
cheerfulness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as his friends had never witnessed 
in him before.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His heart was now open to Elinor, 
all its weaknesses,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all its errors confessed, and his 
first boyish attachment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Lucy treated with all the philosophic 
dignity of twenty-four.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;It was a foolish, idle inclination 
on my side,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said he, &quot;the consequence of 
ignorance of the world--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and want of employment. Had my brother 
given me</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some active profession when I was 
removed at eighteen</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the care of Mr. Pratt, I think--nay, 
I am sure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it would never have happened; for 
though I left Longstaple</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with what I thought, at the time, 
a most unconquerable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">preference for his niece, yet had 
I then had any pursuit,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">any object to engage my time and keep 
me at a distance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from her for a few months, I should 
very soon have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">outgrown the fancied attachment, especially 
by mixing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more with the world, as in such case 
I must have done.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But instead of having any thing to 
do, instead of having any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">profession chosen for me, or being 
allowed to chuse any myself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I returned home to be completely idle; 
and for the first</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">twelvemonth afterwards I had not even 
the nominal employment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which belonging to the university 
would have given me;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for I was not entered at Oxford till 
I was nineteen.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I had therefore nothing in the world 
to do, but to fancy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">myself in love; and as my mother did 
not make my home</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in every respect comfortable, as I 
had no friend,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no companion in my brother, and disliked 
new acquaintance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was not unnatural for me to be 
very often at Longstaple,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">where I always felt myself at home, 
and was always sure</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of a welcome; and accordingly I spent 
the greatest part</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of my time there from eighteen to 
nineteen: Lucy appeared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">everything that was amiable and obliging.  
She was pretty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">too--at least I thought so THEN; and 
I had seen so little</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of other women, that I could make 
no comparisons, and see</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no defects.  Considering everything, 
therefore, I hope,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">foolish as our engagement was, foolish 
as it has since</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in every way been proved, it was not 
at the time an unnatural</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or an inexcusable piece of folly.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The change which a few hours had wrought 
in the minds</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the happiness of the Dashwoods, 
was such--so great--as</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">promised them all, the satisfaction 
of a sleepless night.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood, too happy to be comfortable, 
knew not how</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to love Edward, nor praise Elinor 
enough, how to be enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thankful for his release without wounding 
his delicacy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor how at once to give them leisure 
for unrestrained</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">conversation together, and yet enjoy, 
as she wished,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the sight and society of both.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne could speak HER happiness 
only by tears.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Comparisons would occur--regrets would 
arise;--and her joy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though sincere as her love for her 
sister, was of a kind to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">give her neither spirits nor language.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But Elinor--how are HER feelings to 
be described?--From</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the moment of learning that Lucy was 
married to another,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that Edward was free, to the moment 
of his justifying</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the hopes which had so instantly followed, 
she was every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thing by turns but tranquil.  But 
when the second moment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had passed, when she found every doubt, 
every solicitude</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">removed, compared her situation with 
what so lately it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been,--saw him honourably released 
from his former</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">engagement, saw him instantly profiting 
by the release,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to address herself and declare an 
affection as tender,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as constant as she had ever supposed 
it to be,--she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was oppressed, she was overcome by 
her own felicity;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and happily disposed as is the human 
mind to be easily</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">familiarized with any change for the 
better, it required</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">several hours to give sedateness to 
her spirits, or any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">degree of tranquillity to her heart.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward was now fixed at the cottage 
at least for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a week;--for whatever other claims 
might be made on him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was impossible that less than a 
week should be given</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">up to the enjoyment of Elinor's company, 
or suffice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to say half that was to be said of 
the past, the present,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the future;--for though a very 
few hours spent in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the hard labor of incessant talking 
will despatch more</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">subjects than can really be in common 
between any two</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">rational creatures, yet with lovers 
it is different.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Between THEM no subject is finished, 
no communication</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is even made, till it has been made 
at least twenty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">times over.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy's marriage, the unceasing and 
reasonable wonder</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">among them all, formed of course one 
of the earliest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">discussions of the lovers;--and Elinor's 
particular knowledge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of each party made it appear to her 
in every view, as one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the most extraordinary and unaccountable 
circumstances</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had ever heard.  How they could 
be thrown together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and by what attraction Robert could 
be drawn on to marry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a girl, of whose beauty she had herself 
heard him speak</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without any admiration,--a girl too 
already engaged</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to his brother, and on whose account 
that brother had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thrown off by his family--it was beyond 
her comprehension</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to make out.  To her own heart it 
was a delightful affair,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her imagination it was even a ridiculous 
one, but </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her reason, her judgment, it was 
completely a puzzle.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward could only attempt an explanation 
by supposing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that, perhaps, at first accidentally 
meeting, the vanity</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the one had been so worked on by 
the flattery</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the other, as to lead by degrees 
to all the rest.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor remembered what Robert had 
told her in Harley Street,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his opinion of what his own mediation 
in his brother's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">affairs might have done, if applied 
to in time.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She repeated it to Edward.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;THAT was exactly like Robert,&quot;--was 
his immediate </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">observation.--&quot;And THAT,&quot; 
he presently added, &quot;might </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">perhaps be in HIS head when the acquaintance 
between </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">them first began.  And Lucy perhaps 
at first might </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">think only of procuring his good offices 
in my favour.  </p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Other designs might afterward arise.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">How long it had been carrying on between 
them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, he was equally at a loss 
with herself to make out;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for at Oxford, where he had remained 
for choice ever since</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his quitting London, he had had no 
means of hearing of her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but from herself, and her letters 
to the very last were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">neither less frequent, nor less affectionate 
than usual.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, 
had ever occurred</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to prepare him for what followed;--and 
when at last it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">burst on him in a letter from Lucy 
herself, he had been</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for some time, he believed, half stupified 
between</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the wonder, the horror, and the joy 
of such a deliverance.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He put the letter into Elinor's hands.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;DEAR SIR,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;Being very sure I have 
long lost your affections,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     I have thought myself at liberty 
to bestow my own</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    on another, and have no doubt 
of being as happy with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     him as I once used to think I 
might be with you;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     but I scorn to accept a hand 
while the heart was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    another's.  Sincerely wish you 
happy in your choice,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     and it shall not be my fault 
if we are not always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     good friends, as our near relationship 
now makes</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     proper. I can safely say I owe 
you no ill-will,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     and am sure you will be too generous 
to do us any</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     ill offices.  Your brother has 
gained my affections</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     entirely, and as we could not 
live without one</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     another, we are just returned 
from the altar, and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    are now on our way to Dawlish 
for a few weeks, which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     place your dear brother has great 
curiosity to see,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     but thought I would first trouble 
you with these</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    few lines, and shall always remain,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;Your sincere well-wisher, 
friend, and sister,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">                                        
&quot;LUCY FERRARS.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     &quot;I have burnt all your letters, 
and will return</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     your picture the first opportunity.  
Please to destroy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">     my scrawls--but the ring with 
my hair you are very</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">    welcome to keep.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor read and returned it without 
any comment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I will not ask your opinion 
of it as a composition,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said Edward.--&quot;For worlds would 
not I have had a letter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of hers seen by YOU in former days.--In 
a sister it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is bad enough, but in a wife!--how 
I have blushed over</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the pages of her writing!--and I believe 
I may say that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">since the first half year of our foolish--business--this</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is the only letter I ever received 
from her, of which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the substance made me any amends for 
the defect of the style.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;However it may have come about,&quot; 
said Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after a pause,--&quot;they are certainly 
married.  And your mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">has brought on herself a most appropriate 
punishment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The independence she settled on Robert, 
through resentment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">against you, has put it in his power 
to make his own choice;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and she has actually been bribing 
one son with a thousand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a-year, to do the very deed which 
she disinherited the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other for intending to do.  She will 
hardly be less hurt,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I suppose, by Robert's marrying Lucy, 
than she would have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been by your marrying her.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;She will be more hurt by it, 
for Robert always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was her favourite.--She will be more 
hurt by it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and on the same principle will forgive 
him much sooner.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In what state the affair stood at 
present between them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward knew not, for no communication 
with any of his family</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had yet been attempted by him.  He 
had quitted Oxford</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">within four and twenty hours after 
Lucy's letter arrived,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and with only one object before him, 
the nearest road</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Barton, had had no leisure to form 
any scheme of conduct,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with which that road did not hold 
the most intimate connection.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He could do nothing till he were assured 
of his fate with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Miss Dashwood; and by his rapidity 
in seeking THAT fate,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it is to be supposed, in spite of 
the jealousy with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which he had once thought of Colonel 
Brandon, in spite</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of the modesty with which he rated 
his own deserts,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the politeness with which he talked 
of his doubts,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he did not, upon the whole, expect 
a very cruel reception.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was his business, however, to say 
that he DID, and he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said it very prettily.  What he might 
say on the subject</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a twelvemonth after, must be referred 
to the imagination</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of husbands and wives.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive, 
to go off</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with a flourish of malice against 
him in her message</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by Thomas, was perfectly clear to 
Elinor; and Edward himself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now thoroughly enlightened on her 
character, had no</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">scruple in believing her capable of 
the utmost meanness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of wanton ill-nature. Though his eyes 
had been long opened,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even before his acquaintance with 
Elinor began, to her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ignorance and a want of liberality 
in some of her opinions--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they had been equally imputed, by 
him, to her want</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of education; and till her last letter 
reached him,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he had always believed her to be a 
well-disposed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">good-hearted girl, and thoroughly 
attached to himself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Nothing but such a persuasion could 
have prevented</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his putting an end to an engagement, 
which, long before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the discovery of it laid him open 
to his mother's anger,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been a continual source of disquiet 
and regret to him.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I thought it my duty,&quot; 
said he, &quot;independent of my feelings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to give her the option of continuing 
the engagement or not,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">when I was renounced by my mother, 
and stood to all</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">appearance without a friend in the 
world to assist me.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In such a situation as that, where 
there seemed nothing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to tempt the avarice or the vanity 
of any living creature,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">how could I suppose, when she so earnestly, 
so warmly insisted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on sharing my fate, whatever it might 
be, that any thing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the most disinterested affection 
was her inducement?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And even now, I cannot comprehend 
on what motive she acted,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or what fancied advantage it could 
be to her, to be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">fettered to a man for whom she had 
not the smallest regard,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and who had only two thousand pounds 
in the world.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She could not foresee that Colonel 
Brandon would give me a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">living.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;No; but she might suppose that 
something would occur</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in your favour; that your own family 
might in time relent.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And at any rate, she lost nothing 
by continuing the engagement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for she has proved that it fettered 
neither her inclination</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor her actions.  The connection was 
certainly a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">respectable one, and probably gained 
her consideration among</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her friends; and, if nothing more 
advantageous occurred,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it would be better for her to marry 
YOU than be single.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward was, of course, immediately 
convinced that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing could have been more natural 
than Lucy's conduct,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor more self-evident than the motive 
of it.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor scolded him, harshly as ladies 
always scold</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the imprudence which compliments themselves, 
for having</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">spent so much time with them at Norland, 
when he must</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have felt his own inconstancy.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Your behaviour was certainly 
very wrong,&quot; said she;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;because--to say nothing of my 
own conviction, our relations</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were all led away by it to fancy and 
expect WHAT, as you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were THEN situated, could never be.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He could only plead an ignorance of 
his own heart,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and a mistaken confidence in the force 
of his engagement.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I was simple enough to think, 
that because my FAITH</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was plighted to another, there could 
be no danger in my being</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with you; and that the consciousness 
of my engagement was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to keep my heart as safe and sacred 
as my honour. I felt</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that I admired you, but I told myself 
it was only friendship;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and till I began to make comparisons 
between yourself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Lucy, I did not know how far I 
was got. After that,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">I suppose, I WAS wrong in remaining 
so much in Sussex,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the arguments with which I reconciled 
myself to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">expediency of it, were no better than 
these:--The danger</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is my own; I am doing no injury to 
anybody but myself.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor smiled, and shook her head.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward heard with pleasure of Colonel 
Brandon's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">being expected at the Cottage, as 
he really wished</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not only to be better acquainted with 
him, but to have an</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">opportunity of convincing him that 
he no longer resented</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his giving him the living of Delaford--&quot;Which, 
at present,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said he,&quot;after thanks so ungraciously 
delivered as mine</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were on the occasion, he must think 
I have never forgiven</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him for offering.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">NOW he felt astonished himself that 
he had never yet</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been to the place.  But so little 
interest had be taken</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the matter, that he owed all his 
knowledge of the house,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">garden, and glebe, extent of the parish, 
condition of</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the land, and rate of the tithes, 
to Elinor herself,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">who had heard so much of it from Colonel 
Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and heard it with so much attention, 
as to be entirely</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mistress of the subject.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">One question after this only remained 
undecided,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">between them, one difficulty only 
was to be overcome.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were brought together by mutual 
affection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the warmest approbation of their 
real friends;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their intimate knowledge of each other 
seemed to make</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their happiness certain--and they 
only wanted something</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to live upon.  Edward had two thousand 
pounds, and Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one, which, with Delaford living, 
was all that they could</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">call their own; for it was impossible 
that Mrs. Dashwood</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">should advance anything; and they 
were neither of them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">quite enough in love to think that 
three hundred and fifty</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pounds a-year would supply them with 
the comforts of life.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Edward was not entirely without hopes 
of some</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">favourable change in his mother towards 
him; and on THAT</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he rested for the residue of their 
income.  But Elinor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had no such dependence; for since 
Edward would still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be unable to marry Miss Morton, and 
his chusing herself</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had been spoken of in Mrs. Ferrars's 
flattering language</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as only a lesser evil than his chusing 
Lucy Steele,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she feared that Robert's offence would 
serve no other</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">purpose than to enrich Fanny.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">About four days after Edward's arrival 
Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon appeared, to complete Mrs. 
Dashwood's satisfaction,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to give her the dignity of having, 
for the first time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">since her living at Barton, more company 
with her than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her house would hold.  Edward was 
allowed to retain the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">privilege of first comer, and Colonel 
Brandon therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">walked every night to his old quarters 
at the Park;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from whence he usually returned in 
the morning, early enough</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to interrupt the lovers' first tete-a-tete 
before breakfast.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">A three weeks' residence at Delaford, 
where,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in his evening hours at least, he 
had little to do</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but to calculate the disproportion 
between thirty-six</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and seventeen, brought him to Barton 
in a temper of mind</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which needed all the improvement in 
Marianne's looks,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all the kindness of her welcome, and 
all the encouragement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her mother's language, to make 
it cheerful.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Among such friends, however, and such 
flattery, he did revive.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">No rumour of Lucy's marriage had yet 
reached him:--he knew</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nothing of what had passed; and the 
first hours of his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">visit were consequently spent in hearing 
and in wondering.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Every thing was explained to him by 
Mrs. Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and he found fresh reason to rejoice 
in what he had done</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for Mr. Ferrars, since eventually 
it promoted the interest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It would be needless to say, that 
the gentlemen advanced</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the good opinion of each other, 
as they advanced in each</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">other's acquaintance, for it could 
not be otherwise.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Their resemblance in good principles 
and good sense,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in disposition and manner of thinking, 
would probably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have been sufficient to unite them 
in friendship,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without any other attraction; but 
their being in love</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with two sisters, and two sisters 
fond of each other,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">made that mutual regard inevitable 
and immediate,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which might otherwise have waited 
the effect of time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and judgment.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The letters from town, which a few 
days before would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have made every nerve in Elinor's 
body thrill with transport,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">now arrived to be read with less emotion 
that mirth.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings wrote to tell the wonderful 
tale, to vent her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">honest indignation against the jilting 
girl, and pour forth</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her compassion towards poor Mr. Edward, 
who, she was sure,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had quite doted upon the worthless 
hussy, and was now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by all accounts, almost broken-hearted, 
at Oxford.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I do think,&quot;she continued, 
&quot;nothing was ever carried</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on so sly; for it was but two days 
before Lucy called</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sat a couple of hours with me.  
Not a soul suspected</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">anything of the matter, not even Nancy, 
who, poor soul!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">came crying to me the day after, in 
a great fright</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, as well 
as not knowing how to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">get to Plymouth; for Lucy it seems 
borrowed all her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">money before she went off to be married, 
on purpose</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">we suppose to make a show with, and 
poor Nancy had not</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seven shillings in the world;--so 
I was very glad to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her five guineas to take her down 
to Exeter, where she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thinks of staying three or four weeks 
with Mrs. Burgess,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in hopes, as I tell her, to fall in 
with the Doctor again.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">And I must say that Lucy's crossness 
not to take them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">along with them in the chaise is worse 
than all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Poor Mr. Edward! I cannot get him 
out of my head, but you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">must send for him to Barton, and Miss 
Marianne must try to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">comfort him.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mr. Dashwood's strains were more solemn.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Ferrars was the most unfortunate 
of women--poor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Fanny had suffered agonies of sensibility--and 
he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">considered the existence of each, 
under such a blow,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with grateful wonder.  Robert's offence 
was unpardonable,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but Lucy's was infinitely worse.  
Neither of them were</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ever again to be mentioned to Mrs. 
Ferrars; and even,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">if she might hereafter be induced 
to forgive her son,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his wife should never be acknowledged 
as her daughter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor be permitted to appear in her 
presence.  The secrecy</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with which everything had been carried 
on between them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was rationally treated as enormously 
heightening</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the crime, because, had any suspicion 
of it occurred</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to the others, proper measures would 
have been taken</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to prevent the marriage; and he called 
on Elinor to join</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with him in regretting that Lucy's 
engagement with Edward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had not rather been fulfilled, than 
that she should thus</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">be the means of spreading misery farther 
in the family.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He thus continued:</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;Mrs. Ferrars has never yet mentioned 
Edward's name,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which does not surprise us; but, to 
our great astonishment,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not a line has been received from 
him on the occasion.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Perhaps, however, he is kept silent 
by his fear of offending,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and I shall, therefore, give him a 
hint, by a line</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to Oxford, that his sister and I both 
think a letter</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of proper submission from him, addressed 
perhaps to Fanny,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and by her shewn to her mother, might 
not be taken amiss;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for we all know the tenderness of 
Mrs. Ferrars's heart,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that she wishes for nothing so 
much as to be on good terms</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with her children.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">This paragraph was of some importance 
to the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">prospects and conduct of Edward.  
It determined him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to attempt a reconciliation, though 
not exactly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the manner pointed out by their 
brother and sister.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;A letter of proper submission!&quot;repeated 
he;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;would they have me beg my mother's 
pardon for Robert's</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ingratitude to HER, and breach of 
honour to ME?--I can</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">make no submission--I am grown neither 
humble nor</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">penitent by what has passed.--I am 
grown very happy;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but that would not interest.--I know 
of no submission</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">that IS proper for me to make.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;You may certainly ask to be 
forgiven,&quot; said Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;because you have offended;--and 
I should think you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might NOW venture so far as to profess 
some concern</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for having ever formed the engagement 
which drew on you</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">your mother's anger.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He agreed that he might.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And when she has forgiven you, 
perhaps a little humility</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may be convenient while acknowledging 
a second engagement,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">almost as imprudent in HER eyes as 
the first.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He had nothing to urge against it, 
but still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">resisted the idea of a letter of proper 
submission;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and therefore, to make it easier to 
him, as he declared</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a much greater willingness to make 
mean concessions</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by word of mouth than on paper, it 
was resolved that,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">instead of writing to Fanny, he should 
go to London,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and personally intreat her good offices 
in his favour.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;And if they really DO interest 
themselves,&quot; said Marianne,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her new character of candour, &quot;in 
bringing about</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a reconciliation, I shall think that 
even John and Fanny</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">are not entirely without merit.&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After a visit on Colonel Brandon's 
side of only three</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or four days, the two gentlemen quitted 
Barton together.--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were to go immediately to Delaford, 
that Edward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might have some personal knowledge 
of his future home,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and assist his patron and friend in 
deciding on what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">improvements were needed to it; and 
from thence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after staying there a couple of nights, 
he was to proceed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on his journey to town.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">CHAPTER 50</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">After a proper resistance on the part 
of Mrs. Ferrars,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">just so violent and so steady as to 
preserve her from that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">reproach which she always seemed fearful 
of incurring,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the reproach of being too amiable, 
Edward was admitted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to her presence, and pronounced to 
be again her son.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Her family had of late been exceedingly 
fluctuating.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">For many years of her life she had 
had two sons;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">but the crime and annihilation of 
Edward a few weeks ago,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had robbed her of one; the similar 
annihilation of Robert</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had left her for a fortnight without 
any; and now,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by the resuscitation of Edward, she 
had one again.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">In spite of his being allowed once 
more to live,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">however, he did not feel the continuance 
of his existence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">secure, till he had revealed his present 
engagement;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for the publication of that circumstance, 
he feared,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">might give a sudden turn to his constitution, 
and carry</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">him off as rapidly as before. With 
apprehensive caution</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">therefore it was revealed, and he 
was listened to with</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">unexpected calmness. Mrs. Ferrars 
at first reasonably</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">endeavoured to dissuade him from marrying 
Miss Dashwood,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by every argument in her power;--told 
him, that in Miss Morton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he would have a woman of higher rank 
and larger fortune;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and enforced the assertion, by observing 
that Miss Morton</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was the daughter of a nobleman with 
thirty thousand pounds,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">while Miss Dashwood was only the daughter 
of a private</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">gentleman with no more than THREE; 
but when she found that,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though perfectly admitting the truth 
of her representation,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he was by no means inclined to be 
guided by it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she judged it wisest, from the experience 
of the past,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to submit--and therefore, after such 
an ungracious delay</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as she owed to her own dignity, and 
as served to prevent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">every suspicion of good-will, she 
issued her decree</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of consent to the marriage of Edward 
and Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What she would engage to do towards 
augmenting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their income was next to be considered; 
and here it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">plainly appeared, that though Edward 
was now her only son,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he was by no means her eldest; for 
while Robert was</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">inevitably endowed with a thousand 
pounds a-year,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">not the smallest objection was made 
against Edward's taking</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">orders for the sake of two hundred 
and fifty at the utmost;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">nor was anything promised either for 
the present or in future,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">beyond the ten thousand pounds, which 
had been given with Fanny.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">It was as much, however, as was desired,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and more than was expected, by Edward 
and Elinor;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her shuffling 
excuses,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">seemed the only person surprised at 
her not giving more.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With an income quite sufficient to 
their wants</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">thus secured to them, they had nothing 
to wait for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after Edward was in possession of 
the living, but the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">readiness of the house, to which Colonel 
Brandon,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with an eager desire for the accommodation 
of Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was making considerable improvements; 
and after waiting</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">some time for their completion, after 
experiencing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as usual, a thousand disappointments 
and delays</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from the unaccountable dilatoriness 
of the workmen, Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as usual, broke through the first 
positive resolution</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of not marrying till every thing was 
ready, and the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">ceremony took place in Barton church 
early in the autumn.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The first month after their marriage 
was spent</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with their friend at the Mansion-house; 
from whence</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they could superintend the progress 
of the Parsonage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and direct every thing as they liked 
on the spot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could chuse papers, project shrubberies, 
and invent a sweep.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Jennings's prophecies, though 
rather jumbled together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">were chiefly fulfilled; for she was 
able to visit Edward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and his wife in their Parsonage by 
Michaelmas, and she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">found in Elinor and her husband, as 
she really believed,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">one of the happiest couples in the 
world.  They had</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in fact nothing to wish for, but the 
marriage of Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon and Marianne, and rather better 
pasturage for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">their cows.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They were visited on their first settling 
by almost</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">all their relations and friends.  
Mrs. Ferrars came</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to inspect the happiness which she 
was almost ashamed</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of having authorised; and even the 
Dashwoods were at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the expense of a journey from Sussex 
to do them honour.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&quot;I will not say that I am disappointed, 
my dear sister,&quot;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">said John, as they were walking together 
one morning before</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the gates of Delaford House, &quot;THAT 
would be saying too much,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for certainly you have been one of 
the most fortunate young</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">women in the world, as it is.  But, 
I confess, it would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">give me great pleasure to call Colonel 
Brandon brother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His property here, his place, his 
house, every thing is in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">such respectable and excellent condition!--and 
his woods!--I</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have not seen such timber any where 
in Dorsetshire, as there</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">is now standing in Delaford Hanger!--And 
though, perhaps,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne may not seem exactly the 
person to attract him--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">yet I think it would altogether be 
advisable for you to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">have them now frequently staying with 
you, for as Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon seems a great deal at home, 
nobody can tell what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may happen--for, when people are much 
thrown together,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and see little of anybody else--and 
it will always be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in your power to set her off to advantage, 
and so forth;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in short, you may as well give her 
a chance--You understand</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">me.&quot;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But though Mrs. Ferrars DID come to 
see them, and always</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">treated them with the make-believe 
of decent affection,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they were never insulted by her real 
favour and preference.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">THAT was due to the folly of Robert, 
and the cunning</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of his wife; and it was earned by 
them before many months</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">had passed away.  The selfish sagacity 
of the latter,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which had at first drawn Robert into 
the scrape,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was the principal instrument of his 
deliverance from it;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her respectful humility, assiduous 
attentions,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and endless flatteries, as soon as 
the smallest opening</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was given for their exercise, reconciled 
Mrs. Ferrars</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to his choice, and re-established 
him completely in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her favour.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the 
affair,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and the prosperity which crowned it, 
therefore, may be held</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">forth as a most encouraging instance 
of what an earnest,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">an unceasing attention to self-interest, 
however its progress</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">may be apparently obstructed, will 
do in securing every</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">advantage of fortune, with no other 
sacrifice than that of time</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and conscience.  When Robert first 
sought her acquaintance,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and privately visited her in Bartlett's 
Buildings,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">it was only with the view imputed 
to him by his brother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He merely meant to persuade her to 
give up the engagement;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and as there could be nothing to overcome 
but the affection</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of both, he naturally expected that 
one or two interviews</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">would settle the matter.  In that 
point, however,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and that only, he erred;--for though 
Lucy soon gave him</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">hopes that his eloquence would convince 
her in TIME,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">another visit, another conversation, 
was always wanted</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to produce this conviction.  Some 
doubts always lingered</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in her mind when they parted, which 
could only be</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">removed by another half hour's discourse 
with himself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His attendance was by this means secured, 
and the rest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">followed in course.  Instead of talking 
of Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they came gradually to talk only of 
Robert,--a subject</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">on which he had always more to say 
than on any other,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in which she soon betrayed an 
interest even equal</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to his own; and in short, it became 
speedily evident</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to both, that he had entirely supplanted 
his brother.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He was proud of his conquest, proud 
of tricking Edward,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and very proud of marrying privately 
without his</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">mother's consent.  What immediately 
followed is known.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They passed some months in great happiness 
at Dawlish;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for she had many relations and old 
acquaintances to</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">cut--and he drew several plans for 
magnificent cottages;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and from thence returning to town, 
procured the forgiveness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient 
of asking it,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which, at Lucy's instigation, was 
adopted.  The forgiveness,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">at first, indeed, as was reasonable, 
comprehended only Robert;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Lucy, who had owed his mother 
no duty and therefore</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">could have transgressed none, still 
remained some weeks</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">longer unpardoned.  But perseverance 
in humility of conduct</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and messages, in self-condemnation 
for Robert's offence,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and gratitude for the unkindness she 
was treated with,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">procured her in time the haughty notice 
which overcame</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">her by its graciousness, and led soon 
afterwards, by rapid</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">degrees, to the highest state of affection 
and influence.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy became as necessary to Mrs. Ferrars, 
as either Robert</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or Fanny; and while Edward was never 
cordially forgiven</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for having once intended to marry 
her, and Elinor,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">though superior to her in fortune 
and birth, was spoken</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of as an intruder, SHE was in every 
thing considered,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and always openly acknowledged, to 
be a favourite child.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They settled in town, received very 
liberal assistance</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best 
terms imaginable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">with the Dashwoods; and setting aside 
the jealousies</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and ill-will continually subsisting 
between Fanny and Lucy,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in which their husbands of course 
took a part, as well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as the frequent domestic disagreements 
between Robert and</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed 
the harmony in which</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">they all lived together.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">What Edward had done to forfeit the 
right of eldest</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">son, might have puzzled many people 
to find out; and what</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Robert had done to succeed to it, 
might have puzzled them</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">still more.  It was an arrangement, 
however, justified in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">its effects, if not in its cause; 
for nothing ever</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">appeared in Robert's style of living 
or of talking to give</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a suspicion of his regretting the 
extent of his income,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as either leaving his brother too 
little, or bringing</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">himself too much;--and if Edward might 
be judged from</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the ready discharge of his duties 
in every particular,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">from an increasing attachment to his 
wife and his home,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and from the regular cheerfulness 
of his spirits,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he might be supposed no less contented 
with his lot,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">no less free from every wish of an 
exchange.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Elinor's marriage divided her as little 
from her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">family as could well be contrived, 
without rendering</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the cottage at Barton entirely useless, 
for her mother</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and sisters spent much more than half 
their time with her.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives 
of policy as well</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">as pleasure in the frequency of her 
visits at Delaford;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">for her wish of bringing Marianne 
and Colonel Brandon together</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was hardly less earnest, though rather 
more liberal than</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">what John had expressed. It was now 
her darling object.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Precious as was the company of her 
daughter to her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she desired nothing so much as to 
give up its constant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">enjoyment to her valued friend; and 
to see Marianne settled at</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the mansion-house was equally the 
wish of Edward and Elinor.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">They each felt his sorrows, and their 
own obligations,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and Marianne, by general consent, 
was to be the reward</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of all.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">With such a confederacy against her--with 
a knowledge</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">so intimate of his goodness--with 
a conviction of his fond</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">attachment to herself, which at last, 
though long after it</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was observable to everybody else--burst 
on her--what could she</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">do?</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary 
fate.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was born to discover the falsehood 
of her own opinions,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and to counteract, by her conduct, 
her most favourite maxims.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">She was born to overcome an affection 
formed so late</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in life as at seventeen, and with 
no sentiment</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">superior to strong esteem and lively 
friendship,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">voluntarily to give her hand to another!--and 
THAT other,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a man who had suffered no less than 
herself under the</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">event of a former attachment, whom, 
two years before,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she had considered too old to be married,--and 
who still</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sought the constitutional safeguard 
of a flannel waistcoat!</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">But so it was.  Instead of falling 
a sacrifice</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to an irresistible passion, as once 
she had fondly</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">flattered herself with expecting,--instead 
of remaining</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">even for ever with her mother, and 
finding her only</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">pleasures in retirement and study, 
as afterwards in her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">more calm and sober judgment she had 
determined on,--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">she found herself at nineteen, submitting 
to new attachments,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">entering on new duties, placed in 
a new home, a wife,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">the mistress of a family, and the 
patroness of a village.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Colonel Brandon was now as happy, 
as all those who best</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">loved him, believed he deserved to 
be;--in Marianne he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">was consoled for every past affliction;--her 
regard and her</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">society restored his mind to animation, 
and his spirits</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">to cheerfulness; and that Marianne 
found her own happiness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in forming his, was equally the persuasion 
and delight</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of each observing friend.  Marianne 
could never love</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">by halves; and her whole heart became, 
in time, as much</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">devoted to her husband, as it had 
once been to Willoughby.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Willoughby could not hear of her marriage 
without</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">a pang; and his punishment was soon 
afterwards complete</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in the voluntary forgiveness of Mrs. 
Smith, who, by stating</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">his marriage with a woman of character, 
as the source</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of her clemency, gave him reason for 
believing that had he</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">behaved with honour towards Marianne, 
he might at once have</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">been happy and rich.  That his repentance 
of misconduct,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">which thus brought its own punishment, 
was sincere,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">need not be doubted;--nor that he 
long thought of Colonel</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Brandon with envy, and of Marianne 
with regret. But that</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">he was for ever inconsolable, that 
he fled from society,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">or contracted an habitual gloom of 
temper, or died of a</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">broken heart, must not be depended 
on--for he did neither.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">He lived to exert, and frequently 
to enjoy himself.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">His wife was not always out of humour, 
nor his home</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">always uncomfortable; and in his breed 
of horses and dogs,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and in sporting of every kind, he 
found no inconsiderable</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">degree of domestic felicity.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">For Marianne, however--in spite of 
his incivility</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">in surviving her loss--he always retained 
that decided</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">regard which interested him in every 
thing that befell her,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and made her his secret standard of 
perfection in woman;--</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and many a rising beauty would be 
slighted by him in</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">after-days as bearing no comparison 
with Mrs. Brandon.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to 
remain at the cottage,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">without attempting a removal to Delaford; 
and fortunately for</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, when Marianne 
was taken from them,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Margaret had reached an age highly 
suitable for dancing,</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">and not very ineligible for being 
supposed to have a lover.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">Between Barton and Delaford, there 
was that constant</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">communication which strong family 
affection would</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">naturally dictate;--and among the 
merits and the happiness</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">of Elinor and Marianne, let it not 
be ranked as the least</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">considerable, that though sisters, 
and living almost within</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">sight of each other, they could live 
without disagreement</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">between themselves, or producing coolness 
between their husbands.</p>
<p class="CSS-p-MsoPlainText">&nbsp;</p>
